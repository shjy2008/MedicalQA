Question:
A 62-year-old woman has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. She develops a macular rash on her neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but she returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. She has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. She has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, her vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel’s solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

[A] : Acute interstitial nephritis
[B] : Acute glomerulonephritis
[C] : Acute tubular necrosis

Question:
A 62-year-old woman has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. She develops a macular rash on her neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but she returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. She has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. She has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, her vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel’s solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

[A] : Acute interstitial nephritis
[B] : Acute glomerulonephritis
[C] : Acute tubular necrosis

Question:
A 61-year-old man with a history of stage IIIa lung adenocarcinoma that has been treated with wedge resection and chemotherapy presents to the primary care clinic. He is largely asymptomatic, but he demonstrates a persistent microcytic anemia despite iron supplementation. Colonoscopy performed 3 years earlier was unremarkable. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a child, and hypercholesterolemia. He currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of pinot grigio per day, and currently denies any illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7°C (98.0°F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min. On physical examination, his pulses are bounding, complexion is pale, but breath sounds remain clear.

A case of lobular carcinoma in situ presenting as a solid mass.

Question:
A 62-year-old woman presents to her physician with a painless breast mass on her left breast for the past 4 months. She mentions that she noticed the swelling suddenly one day and thought it would resolve by itself. Instead, it has been slowly increasing in size. On physical examination of the breasts, the physician notes a single non-tender, hard, and fixed nodule over left breast. An ultrasonogram of the breast shows a solid mass, and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy confirms the mass to be lobular carcinoma of the breast. When the patient asks about her prognosis, the physician says that the prognosis can be best determined after both grading and staging of the tumor. Based on the current diagnostic information, the physician says that they can only grade, but no stage, the neoplasm. Which of the following facts about the neoplasm is currently available to the physician?

[A] : The tumor cells exhibit marked nuclear atypia.
[B] : The tumor has metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes.
[C] : The tumor has not metastasized to the contralateral superior mediastinal lymph nodes.

Based on the current diagnostic information, the physician says that they can only grade, but no stage, the neoplasm. Which of the following facts about the neoplasm is currently available to the physician?

[A] : The tumor cells exhibit marked nuclear atypia.
[B] : The tumor has metastasized to the axillary lymph nodes.
[C] : The tumor has not metastasized to the contralateral superior mediastinal lymph nodes.
[D] : The tumor has spread via blood-borne metastasis.
