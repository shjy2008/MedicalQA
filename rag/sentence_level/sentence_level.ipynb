The association of symptomatic lower urinary tract infection with low-count bacteriuria (10(2)-10(5) UFC/mL of urine) was present in all the patients. The incidence of cystourethritis was about 12%, most of the infections occurred at the first trimester. To learn whether a multiple-dose of nitrofurantoin or ampicillin is safe and effective therapy for acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections, 103 symptomatic pregnant women were randomly grouped to receive oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg t.i.d.) or ampicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for five days. Seventeen patient were excluded since they did not return for follow-up. Escherichia coli was isolated in 67% of infections.
