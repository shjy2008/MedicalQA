Effects of varying intraperitoneal pressure on liver function tests during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy at standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum uses a pressure of 12-14 mm Hg, which may cause a variety of adverse physiological changes involving the respiratory, cardiovascular, and hepatorenal systems reflected as subclinical abnormalities in biochemical parameters. The use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum in the range of 8-10 mm Hg has been shown to reduce the adverse physiological changes without affecting the outcome of surgery. This study was done in a randomized controlled manner. Patients with gallstone disease (n=101) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to high-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (HPLC) (n=51) and low-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LPLC) (n=50) and underwent surgery at pressures of 14 mm Hg and 8 mm Hg, respectively. Liver function tests, including total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase, were obtained preoperatively and on postoperative Days 1 and 7. The two study groups had similar demographic profiles, and there were no significant differences in the operative time (HPLC, 47.25 Â± 6.73 minutes; LPLC, 48.00 Â± 7.76 minutes; P=.6071) and pneumoperitoneum time (HPLC, 34.02 Â± 5.29 minutes; LPLC, 34.60 Â± 6.13 minutes; P=.6115). On postoperative Day 1, the total bilirubin levels were 1.0684 Â± 0.4108 mg/dL and 0.8926 Â± 0.3162 mg/dL for HPLC and LPLC (P=.0179), respectively, AST levels were 66.0810 Â± 25.5868 IU/L and 42.2420 Â± 14.7301 IU/L (P=.0001), respectively, and ALT levels were 68.1410 Â± 31.4572 IU/L and 42.7460 Â± 17.9405 IU/L (P=.0001), respectively. Thus, liver enzyme activities were significantly elevated in the HPLC group compared with the LPLC group. LPLC causes less abnormality in liver function tests in the postoperative period compared with HPLC. LPLC should be considered in all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially those patients with compromised liver functions.

The tales of two neighbours: when cholecystitis does not preclude pancreatitis. An 83-year-old lady with no previous history of gallstones, presented with a sudden-onset severe epigastric pain radiating through to the back associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, the patient's vital signs were normal. There was severe epigastric tenderness on palpation, as well as moderate right upper quadrant tenderness. Serological investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and serum lipase of 13 000, confirming the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Liver function tests were mildly deranged with a normal bilirubin of 12 Î¼mol/L. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a distended gallbladder with multiple subcentimeter gallstones and diffuse wall thickening up to 7 mm, consistent with cholecystitis. A follow-up CT abdomen demonstrated evidence of pancreatitis with moderate peripancreatic fat stranding. The diagnosis of concomitant acute cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis was made based on the radiological and biochemical findings. The patient underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The histopathology confirmed cholelithiasis with acute on chronic cholecystitis.

Context:
An 18-Year-Old With Acute-on-Chronic Abdominal Pain. An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

Context:
Biliary obstruction due to a huge simple hepatic cyst treated with laparoscopic resection. Most hepatic cysts are asymptomatic, but complications occasionally occur. We describe a patient with biliary obstruction due to a huge simple hepatic cyst treated with laparoscopic resection. A 60-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of a nontender mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed the following: serum total bilirubin, 0.6 mg/dL; serum aspartate aminotransferase, 100 IU/L; serum alanine aminotransferase, 78 IU/L; serum alkaline phosphatase, 521 IU/L; and serum gamma glutamic transpeptidase, 298 IU/L. Abdominal computed tomography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a huge hepatic cyst, 13 cm in diameter, at the hepatic hilum, accompanied by dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct and obstruction of the common bile duct. We diagnosed biliary obstruction due to a huge hepatic cyst at the hepatic hilum, and laparoscopic surgery was performed. A huge hepatic cyst was seen at the hepatic hilum. After needle puncture of the huge cyst, the anterior wall of the cyst was unroofed, and cholecystectomy was done. Intraoperative cholangiography through a cystic duct revealed stenosis of the duct. Subsequent decapsulation of the cyst was performed in front of the common bile duct. After this procedure, cholangiography revealed that the stenosis of the common bile duct had resolved. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the hepatic cyst was benign. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the results of liver function tests normalized. The patient was discharged 7 days after operation. Computed tomography 3 months after operation revealed disappearance of the hepatic cyst and no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct.

Elevation of serum liver enzymes after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has been accepted as an alternative to laparotomy, and has become the standard treatment of benign gallbladder diseases. However, it has been noticed that (following LC) the serum level of certain liver enzymes raises markedly in patients who had preoperatively normal liver enzyme values. We measured serum values of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio (INR) in 72 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 36 consecutive patients who underwent open cholecystectomy (OC). During laparoscopic surgery, the intra-abdominal pressure was maintained at 14 mmHg of CO2. To assess liver function, serum liver enzymes were measured before operations and at 1,3,7, and 10 days postoperation. Mortality was nil. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, ALT and AST increased statistically significantly in the LC group (ALTLC24: 87.1+/-24.2 U/L P&lt;0.001; ASTLC24:82.8+/-19.1 U/L, p&lt;0.001)--whereas in the OC group, 24 hours after the procedure, the serum value of ALT and AST was above the upper normal limits in only in one patient. A further increase in serum ALT and AST value was observed in the LC group (ALTLC72: 99.3+/-19.5 U/L, p&lt;0.001; ASTLC72H: 103.5+/-21.6 U/L, p&lt;0.001) 72 hours after the operation. The mean value of ALT and AST in the OC group was within normal limits 72 hours after the procedure. Slow return to normality occurred 7-10 days after the procedure in the LC group. Alterations in hepatic function occur after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appear to be clinically insignificant. CO2 pneumoperitoneum seems to be the main reason for theses changes but other factors may also contribute. We also measured the values of ALP, GGT, INR and bilirubin. No statistically significant increase was noticed in any groups between the preoperative and postoperative values of these enzymes.

Thus, liver enzyme activities were significantly elevated in the HPLC group compared with the LPLC group. LPLC causes less abnormality in liver function tests in the postoperative period compared with HPLC. LPLC should be considered in all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially those patients with compromised liver functions.

A case of epigastric pain in the ED: late mechanical complication after vertical banded gastroplasty. A 50-year-old woman presented to our emergency department complaining of recurrent epigastric stabbing pain on eating of 1 month duration. She had a history of morbid obesity treated 13 years before with laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Diagnosis was made by radiology, after upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal unenhanced computed tomography. These demonstrated intragastric band migration, with outlet stenosis of narrowed stomach. Vertical banded gastroplasty is a miniinvasive approach that gives the benefits of shorter hospital stay, less postoperative pain, and quicker functional recovery. However, many complications are known and require recognition to be appropriately treated. In our case, the history and clinical presentation led to a high suspicion of intraabdominal pathology due to postoperative complication. Radiologic upper gastrointestinal investigation and computed tomography findings were then decisive to detect the intragastric band migration.

Gallstone perforation and obstruction of the duodenal bulb. A 69-year-old woman had a large gallstone eroded through the wall of the gallbladder and into the duodenum. The gallstone became fixed within the cholecystoduodenal fistula and produced a duodenal obstruction. At the time of the diagnosis of this problem, the patient had had a three-week period of epigastric pain and prolonged vomiting. She was treated by removal of the stone and cholecystectomy. The duodenal fistula was closed in two layers, and a gastrojejunostomy and a truncal vagotomy were carried out to protect the duodenal suture line. A leak from the duodenal closure developed on the fourth day, but this subsided spontaneously after 15 days with the use of sump drainage. Six months later, the patient is doing well and has a normal duodenum and gastrojejunostomy as shown by upper gastrointestinal barium study.

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome coexists with Nutcracker syndrome in a female: a case report. Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, also known as Wilkie's syndrome or Benign duodenal stasis, is a rare benign disease. It could threaten the life if the manifestation is severe and the treatment is inappropriate. In the patients with SMA syndrome, the third portion (transverse part) of the duodenum is compressed externally between the SMA and abdominal aorta (AA) leading to duodenal stasis and gastrointestinal obstruction. SMA syndrome may rarely combine with Nutcracker syndrome when left renal vein (LRV) was compressed between SMA and AA. A 32-year-old female patient presented with complaints of gradually severe bloating, epigastric pain, left flank ache, nausea and occasional vomiting of 1âmonth's duration. The epigastric and left flank ache was aggravated when the patient was supine and relieved in a prone or left lateral decubitus. The abdominal bloating was associated with early satiety. The vomiting always started 40âmin after meal. The patient gave a history of urine stone with drotaverine hydrochloride tablets treatment for two weeks before the gastrointestinal symptoms arising. The patient had no significant surgical history, but had a rapid weight loss of approximately 10âkg with a body mass index (BMI) from 21âkg/m

Giant hepatic cyst as a cause of gastric outlet obstruction. We describe the case of a 58-year-old female who presented to her primary care provider with lifelong anorexia, 6-week history of liquid only diet and new onset epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back accompanied by nausea and abdominal distension. An initial computed tomography scan with contrast demonstrated a massive simple hepatic cyst with mass effect compression of the duodenal sweep. Repetitive treatment with aspiration sclerotherapy using hypertonic saline provided initial resolution of symptoms and led to substantial reduction of cyst diameter. Repeat imaging demonstrated complete drainage of the cyst and decompression of the duodenum. Ultimately, the patient's symptoms returned 6 weeks later at which time she opted for surgical deroofing of the cyst. Surgery provided for complete resolution. This case appears to be the first to document the compression of second portion of the duodenum by a massive simple hepatic cyst causing anorexia and mimicking gastric outlet obstruction.

Duodenal intramural hematoma due to blunt abdominal trauma. A 14-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with the complaints of epigastric pain and vomiting for three days following epigastric trauma. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the epigastrium without any signs of peritoneal irritation. Vital signs, biochemical analysis, chest and abdominal x-rays were normal. Abdominal US, CT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed that there was a well-defined duodenal intramural mass suggesting hematoma. Intraabdominal solid organs were normal and we did not observe free air or extravasation of contrast media. Therefore, we followed up the patient by US. The hematoma completely resolved 48 days after the trauma.

A case of epigastric pain in the ED: late mechanical complication after vertical banded gastroplasty. A 50-year-old woman presented to our emergency department complaining of recurrent epigastric stabbing pain on eating of 1 month duration. She had a history of morbid obesity treated 13 years before with laparoscopic vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG). Diagnosis was made by radiology, after upper gastrointestinal series and abdominal unenhanced computed tomography. These demonstrated intragastric band migration, with outlet stenosis of narrowed stomach. Vertical banded gastroplasty is a miniinvasive approach that gives the benefits of shorter hospital stay, less postoperative pain, and quicker functional recovery. However, many complications are known and require recognition to be appropriately treated. In our case, the history and clinical presentation led to a high suspicion of intraabdominal pathology due to postoperative complication. Radiologic upper gastrointestinal investigation and computed tomography findings were then decisive to detect the intragastric band migration.

Medical screening and evacuation: cauda equina syndrome in a combat zone. Resident's case problem. Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare, potentially devastating, disorder and is considered a true neurologic emergency. CES often has a rapid clinical progression, making timely recognition and immediate surgical referral essential. A 32-year-old male presented to a medical aid station in Iraq with a history of 4 weeks of insidious onset and recent worsening of low back, left buttock, and posterior left thigh pain. He denied symptoms distal to the knee, paresthesias, saddle anesthesia, or bowel and bladder function changes. At the initial examination, the patient was neurologically intact throughout all lumbosacral levels with negative straight-leg raises. He also presented with severely limited lumbar flexion active range of motion, and reduction of symptoms occurred with repeated lumbar extension. At the follow-up visit, 10 days later, he reported a new, sudden onset of saddle anesthesia, constipation, and urinary hesitancy, with physical exam findings of right plantar flexion weakness, absent right ankle reflex, and decreased anal sphincter tone. No advanced medical imaging capabilities were available locally. Due to suspected CES, the patient was medically evacuated to a neurosurgeon and within 48 hours underwent an emergent L4-5 laminectomy/decompression. He returned to full military duty 18 weeks after surgery without back or lower extremity symptoms or neurological deficit. This case demonstrates the importance of continual medical screening for physical therapists throughout the patient management cycle. It further demonstrates the importance of immediate referral to surgical specialists when CES is suspected, as rapid intervention offers the best prognosis for recovery.

Just the facts: Risk stratifying nontraumatic back pain for Cauda Equina Syndrome in the emergency department. A 43-year-old male, with a history of chronic back pain, presents to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset chronic pain. He states he "tweaked something" and has been debilitated by back pain, radiating down both his legs, for 24 hours. He has not had a bowel movement but denies noticing any "saddle anesthesia." His clinical exam is limited by pain, and it is difficult to determine if he has objective weakness. His perineal sensation is intact, as is his sensation upon digital rectal examination. The patient has a post-void residual of 250 mL, but you are unsure how to interpret this value. As an emergency physician, when should you suspect, and how should you evaluate cauda equina syndrome?


Medical screening and evacuation: cauda equina syndrome in a combat zone. Resident's case problem. Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare, potentially devastating, disorder and is considered a true neurologic emergency. CES often has a rapid clinical progression, making timely recognition and immediate surgical referral essential. A 32-year-old male presented to a medical aid station in Iraq with a history of 4 weeks of insidious onset and recent worsening of low back, left buttock, and posterior left thigh pain. He denied symptoms distal to the knee, paresthesias, saddle anesthesia, or bowel and bladder function changes. At the initial examination, the patient was neurologically intact throughout all lumbosacral levels with negative straight-leg raises. He also presented with severely limited lumbar flexion active range of motion, and reduction of symptoms occurred with repeated lumbar extension. At the follow-up visit, 10 days later, he reported a new, sudden onset of saddle anesthesia, constipation, and urinary hesitancy, with physical exam findings of right plantar flexion weakness, absent right ankle reflex, and decreased anal sphincter tone. No advanced medical imaging capabilities were available locally. Due to suspected CES, the patient was medically evacuated to a neurosurgeon and within 48 hours underwent an emergent L4-5 laminectomy/decompression. He returned to full military duty 18 weeks after surgery without back or lower extremity symptoms or neurological deficit. This case demonstrates the importance of continual medical screening for physical therapists throughout the patient management cycle.

Fast growing penis ulcer: an unusual coincidence. A 57-year-old man was seen with a 2-week history of progressive enlargement of an asymptomatic genital ulcer associated with bilateral inguinal lymphadenomegaly. Multiple unprotected heterosexual contacts were reported. The family doctor misdiagnosed primary syphilis with the following laboratory results: negative findings on the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test, positive findings on the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (titer 1:1280), and IgM negative on the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay. The patient was treated with penicillin G for the diagnosis of indeterminate latent syphilis and initially denied authorization for a skin biopsy. After 2 weeks, fast enlargement of the lesion was documented. He underwent skin biopsy, and the histopathologic examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma, and polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus 16 was positive.

Primary syphilis of the oropharynx: an unusual location of a chancre. A 33-year-old man presented with a two-week history of an asymptomatic ulcer of the oropharynx and submandibular lymph nodes swelling. Laboratory examinations were normal, but serological tests revealed positivity for rapid plasma reagin, Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay and anti-T. pallidum IgM antibodies. Since the patient denied any homosexual relationship, a biopsy of the lesion was performed, which confirmed primary syphilis. The patient received an intramuscular injection of Benzathine Penicillin G (2.4 MU) with complete resolution of the lesion. Extragenital chancres occur in at least 5% of patients with primary syphilis, and the oral mucosa is the most frequent location as a consequence of orogenital/oroanal contact with an infectious lesion. Because of their transient nature, these oral ulcerations are often underestimated by the patient or by any unsuspecting clinician. Health professionals should consider the recent sexual history of their patients and should be prepared to recognise oral and systemic manifestations of sexually transmitted infections.

Solitary frontal ulcer: A syphilitic gumma. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman presenting with a single, deep, asymptomatic frontal ulcer that had developed in the previous two months without preceding trauma. Blood tests revealed reactive Rapid Plasma Reagin and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assays. The diagnosis of syphilitic gumma was confirmed after histological analysis of the ulcer border. No other manifestations of late syphilis were detected. Ulcer healing was observed after treatment with benzathine penicillin and there was progressive reduction of follow-up serum RPR titers. The relevance of this case arises from its unusual presentation in a previously healthy immunocompetent individual.

Neurosyphilis Mimicking Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. A 36-year-old man presented with facial nerve palsy, hearing loss, vertigo and headache. He was initially diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome and treated with a systemic steroid and valaciclovir; however, his symptoms deteriorated. Serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and treponema pallidum hemagglutination tests were positive. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell count and positive RPR, confirming the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Penicillin G (PCG) was administered, and his facial nerve function and headache improved. However, left-side hearing loss worsened temporarily, which was assumed to be a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. Betamethasone was administered along with PCG, and he recovered completely.

Syphilitic periostitis in a newly diagnosed HIV-positive man. A 36-year-old man presented for an HIV test, which answered positive. He gave a six-week history of headache and fever. His syphilis serology was also positive with a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) titre of 1:32, and positive Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay and fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA). When he attended for treatment of the syphilis, he had developed severe pain in both lower limbs. Plain radiographs were normal. An isotope bone scan showed multiple areas of increased uptake, consistent with syphilitic periostitis. Some of these lesions were asymptomatic. He was treated with benzathine penicillin and his pain resolved. The bone scan had normalized after six months. We review the previous literature regarding syphilitic bone pain and periostitis. We discuss the importance of considering syphilis in the differential diagnosis of any sexually active adult presenting with bone pain, and highlight the usefulness of isotope bone scans in clarifying the clinical picture.

Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesuric hypermagnesemia and severe hypocalciuria: a new syndrome? Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, urinary potassium wasting, elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, normotension, and prostaglandinuria. They differ in that hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria are universal in Gitelman's syndrome; 20% of cases of Bartter's syndrome have hypomagnesemia and hypercalciuria. We present a 44-year-old white man referred for hypokalemia. Clinical evaluation was unremarkable. He had hypokalemia (P(K), 2.8 to 3.0 mEq/L), hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mild azotemia (serum creatinine, 1.4 to 1.8 mg/dL; creatinine clearance, 59 mL/min), normocalcemia, marked persistent hypocalciuria (FE(Ca), 0.08% to 0.09%), and normal intact parathyroid hormone levels (51 pg/mL) and glucosuria. He had persistent hypermagnesemia (P(Mg), 2.1 to 2.8 mEq/L) with relative hypomagnesuria (FE(Mg), 3.2% to 5.2%) given the level of renal impairment and hypermagnesemia. Supine plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were high (11 ng/mL/hr and 43 ng/dL, respectively). An excessive dietary intake of magnesium, including medications, was excluded. Studies were performed after withdrawing all medications for 8 days. A maximum water diuresis was established (an oral load of 20 mL/kg; stable Uosm, 120 mOsm/kg), and free water and solute clearances were studied at baseline and after sequential intravenous injections of 125 mg chlorothiazide and 40 mg furosemide. The patient had moderate renal impairment (technetium diethylene triamine pentacetic acid [DTPA] clearance, 35.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) and, in contradistinction to Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, sodium and water handling in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal tubule (fractional distal solute reabsorption) was normal, but there was evidence of a defect in the proximal tubule reabsorption (glucosuria, supranormal C(H2O) and high distal delivery). Hypomagnesuria and hypocalciuria appeared to be secondary to an increase in their absorption in the loop of Henle (increased excretion following furosemide). In conclusion, this combination of metabolic abnormalities has never been described. We postulate a proximal tubular defect in the absorption of NaCl leading to hypocalciuria, hypomagnesuria, and potassium wasting. Whether the tubular defect is primary or secondary to a renal parenchymal disease is, however, unclear.

[Lobenzarit disodium (CCA)--induced diabetes insipidus in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis]. A 44-year-old female with 16-year history of rheumatoid arthritis visited Akiru Hospital with complaints of a thirst, a dry mouth and a general fatigue. One week prior to admission, the patient manifested excessive thirsty feeling, a body weight loss and a sleepless by the polyuria. She has been given 5-10 mg of prednisolone and 240 mg of lobenzarit disodium (CCA) in a day for 11 months. A hematologic examination showed no abnormality, and the examination of her serum showed the following values: BUN, 9.3 mg/dl; creatinine, 0.9 mg/dl; sodium, 139 mEq/l; chloride, 102 mEq/l; potassium, 3.9 mEq/l; osmolality, 290 mOsm/l. Plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) level increased slightly (6.0 pg/ml). Examination of her urine revealed specific gravity, 1.005; no trace of glucose, protein, blood and ketones; normal sediment; and osmolality, 209 mOsm/l. The patient was given exogenous ADH (10 units of vasopressin tannate in oil, intramuscularly) to obtain a diagnosis, and she was found to be unable to concentrate her urine more than 1.008 in the specific gravity. A water restriction, as a test for diabetes insipidus, also failed to concentrate her urine in the specific gravity and in the osmolality. Together with these findings, the patient was diagnosed to be a diabetes insipidus, and CCA was seemed to account for the disease. This unfavorable effect of CCA appeared to be reversible, since the patient recovered her urinary concentrating ability after the medication of CCA was discontinued.

[Therapeutic behavior to follow in the following clinical case: treatment of type 2 diabetes]. A 62-year old woman with obesity, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) was referred to a Vascular Risk Unit of the Internal Medicine Department due to elevated HbA1C (8.1%) in spite of having taken metformin (850 mg/12h) and glipizide (10 mg/12 h) regularly. She tries to exercise daily (walking 30 min) and has lost weight (from 5 to 12 kg) several times, but always regains what she has lost. Furthermore, she monitors her glucose levels in fasting every two weeks and generally has between 120 and 160 mg/dL. Her high blood pressure is being treated with enalapril/HCTZ and she also takes aspirin 100mg/day and simvastatin 20 mg/day. It is seen in her family background that one brother died suddenly at 50 years of age. Her physical examination shows a BMI of 32.4 Kg/m(2), and she has no edemas in the lower limbs. Her BP is 154/82 mmHg and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL. She has no microalbuminuria and her liver function is normal. What treatment do you think would be the more appropriate? 1 - Add glitazones. 2 - Add incretin mimetics (GLP 1/ DPP-4). 3 - Slow acting insulin.

Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesuric hypermagnesemia and severe hypocalciuria: a new syndrome? Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, urinary potassium wasting, elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels, normotension, and prostaglandinuria. They differ in that hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria are universal in Gitelman's syndrome; 20% of cases of Bartter's syndrome have hypomagnesemia and hypercalciuria. We present a 44-year-old white man referred for hypokalemia. Clinical evaluation was unremarkable. He had hypokalemia (P(K), 2.8 to 3.0 mEq/L), hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, mild azotemia (serum creatinine, 1.4 to 1.8 mg/dL; creatinine clearance, 59 mL/min), normocalcemia, marked persistent hypocalciuria (FE(Ca), 0.08% to 0.09%), and normal intact parathyroid hormone levels (51 pg/mL) and glucosuria. He had persistent hypermagnesemia (P(Mg), 2.1 to 2.8 mEq/L) with relative hypomagnesuria (FE(Mg), 3.2% to 5.2%) given the level of renal impairment and hypermagnesemia. Supine plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were high (11 ng/mL/hr and 43 ng/dL, respectively). An excessive dietary intake of magnesium, including medications, was excluded. Studies were performed after withdrawing all medications for 8 days. A maximum water diuresis was established (an oral load of 20 mL/kg; stable Uosm, 120 mOsm/kg), and free water and solute clearances were studied at baseline and after sequential intravenous injections of 125 mg chlorothiazide and 40 mg furosemide. The patient had moderate renal impairment (technetium diethylene triamine pentacetic acid [DTPA] clearance, 35.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) and, in contradistinction to Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes, sodium and water handling in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal tubule (fractional distal solute reabsorption) was normal, but there was evidence of a defect in the proximal tubule reabsorption (glucosuria, supranormal C(H2O) and high distal delivery). Hypomagnesuria and hypocalciuria appeared to be secondary to an increase in their absorption in the loop of Henle (increased excretion following furosemide). In conclusion, this combination of metabolic abnormalities has never been described.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 37-year-old woman presented with increasing abdominal pain and jaundice. Six weeks before admission, she developed persistent diarrhea and jaundice of the skin. She also bruised easily, and her gums bled. In the subsequent weeks, her appetite decreased, she was fatigued, and she had nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. She had a history of drinking 1 quart of vodka every day for 20 years, with brief periods of abstinence; she stopped consuming alcohol 11 days before admission because it no longer provided symptomatic relief. Her past medical history was also notable for depression, including a suicide attempt 4 years earlier. She did not smoke, use illicit drugs, or have unprotected sexual intercourse. She had received no blood transfusions and had not traveled recently. She took no medications, except for occasional ibuprofen. On physical examination, she was thin and deeply jaundiced, and she trembled and responded slowly to questions. She was afebrile but tachypneic, and she had orthostatic hypotension. Her HEENT examination was notable for scleral and sublingual icterus, as well as crusted blood on her gums and teeth. The jugular veins were flat. The cardiac examination revealed tachycardia (heart rate, 103 beats per minute) without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was nontender and protuberant, with hypoactive bowel sounds; the spleen was not palpable, and there was no fluid wave or caput medusae. The liver percussed to 18 cm, with a smooth edge extending 10 cm below the costal margin. She had cutaneous telangiectases on her chest and bilateral palmar erythema. There was no peripheral edema. The neurologic examination was notable for asterixis. Her stool was guaiac positive. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: hematocrit, 21.2%; white blood cells, 17,310/mm(3); ammonia, 42 micromol/L; serum creatinine, 3.9 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 70 mg/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; total bilirubin, 26.8 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase, 14 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 77 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 138 U/L; prothrombin time, 103 seconds (international normalized ratio, 10.6); and urinary sodium, &lt;5 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed an elevated specific gravity and numerous muddy granular casts. Hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. On abdominal ultrasound examination, there was no ascites, and the liver was echogenic. The portal and hepatic veins were patent, and the hepatic arteries were normal. The spleen measured 14 cm.

[Acute kidney failure in a recurrence of sarcoidosis at the height of summer]. A 35-year-old woman with sarcoidosis, successfully treated 3 years previously, developed fatigue, nausea and loss of weight during a summer holiday in Italy where she was exposed to much bright sun. There had been no previous recurrence of the sarcoidosis. On return she was found to be in renal failure with marked hypercalcaemia. Physical examination merely revealed peasized non-tender submandibular and cervical lymph nodes, but was otherwise unremarkable. Serum creatinine and calcium concentrations (3.8 mg/dl and 3.6 mmol/l) were markedly elevated. Computed tomography showed an enlarged submandibular lymph node, but no other organ abnormality. Biopsy of the salivary gland demonstrated recurrent sarcoidosis. Calcium concentration became normal (2.4 mmol/l) within two weeks of treatment with methylprednisolone (100 mg daily for 3 days, followed by gradual reduction to 30 mg daily for 3 months, until discontinued slowly). Creatinine concentration, which had fallen to 1.5 mg/dl, was at the upper limit of normal (1.1 mg/dl) after 4 months and 0.8 mg/dl after 8 months. Marked exposure to UV light should be avoided in patients with a history of recent sarcoidosis, because it increases the formation of vitamin D3 precursors: In the case of recurrent sarcoidosis, these precursors are converted to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the sarcoidosis granulomas. This can lead to severe complications, such as hypercalcaemia and renal failure.

Context:
Severe hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia in an adipsic young woman. Combined deficits in arginine vasopressin secretion (AVP) and thirst sensation can result in life threatening hyperosmolality and hypernatremia. Complications include seizures, profound volume contraction and renal failure. Fortunately, this is an uncommon clinical condition, with approximately 70 cases reported in the literature over the past 47 years [1]. Defects in AVP secretion and/or synthesis produce central diabetes insipidus (DI), polyuria with polydipsia, hypernatremia and hyperosmolality. Most awake and alert patients with an intact thirst stimulus will "drink" themselves back to a normal serum sodium and osmolality. However, if there is concomitant destruction of the osmoreceptors that regulate thirst, osmolal and volume homeostasis cannot be maintained. The relationships between urine osmolarity and serum osmolarity and plasma vasopressin levels are vital for distinguishing a reset osmostat from central DI. After obtaining approval from our institutional review board, we retrospectively reviewed the medical record of a 37-year-old patient who presented to our institution with a serum sodium of 176 mEq/l. Admission laboratory examination revealed: hemoglobin 12.8 g/dl; white blood cell count 4.7 Ã 103/Âµl, with a normal differential; random serum glucose 91 mg/dl ; sodium 176 mEq/l; plasma osmolality 366 mOsm/kg; BUN 33 mg/dl; serum creatinine 1 mg/dl; calcium 9.5 mg/dl; urine specific gravity 1.032; and urine osmolality 1,172 mOsm/kg. An MRI with contrast of the sella/ pituitary revealed an enhancing mass centered within the suprasellar cistern and anterior third ventricle, measuring 3.0 Ã 3.9 Ã 3.4 cm. The lesion appeared to involve the hypothalamus and displaced the optic chiasm inferiorly. Evaluation of pituitary function revealed normal serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, AM cortisol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between measured serum AVP levels and serum osmolality. Figure 2 shows the relationship between measured urine and serum osmolality. If the serum AVP levels were not available, it would appear as though the patient had a reset osmostat. The kidneys appear to appropriately generate maximally concentrated urine at a serum osmolality above 348 but are unable to below this value. When compared with the normal curve, our patient's AVP levels were lower than expected for the corresponding osmolality. This pattern is consistent with a partial central DI. She does not have a reset osmostat. In the presence of significant volume contraction and a reduced GFR, her kidneys produced more concentrated urine despite markedly decreased central vasopressin production. As the volume contraction abated and the GFR improved, polyuria recurred, despite persistent hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia.

When Coke Is Not Hydrating: Cocaine-Induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis. A 47-year-old African American man was admitted with 4 days of back pain, nausea and vomiting, and low urine output. There was no history of fever, dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, viral symptoms, trauma, rash, or constipation. Despite his past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia he denied taking any medications for 18 months, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, or antacids. He denied smoking and alcohol but admitted to cocaine use. No significant FH. Physical examination results were as follows: BP 235/125 mm Hg, heart rate 90 beats/min, temperature 98Â°F, O2 saturation normal; lungs and heart normal, abdomen soft but bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness. Neurological examination was normal. Laboratory tests yielded the following results: creatinine (Cr) 10.5 mg/dL (1.2 mg/dL in 2010), blood urea nitrogen 63 mg/dL, glucose 151 mg/dL, Ca 9.4 mg/dL, PO4 6.1 mg/dL, Hgb 15 g/dL, white blood cells (WBC) 9100, platelets 167 000, amylase/lipase normal, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) normal, bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 39 IU/L, creatine phosphokinase 127 Âµg/L. Hepatic panel, C- and P-ANCA (cytoplasmic- and perinuclear-antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies, respectively), anti-GBM (anti-glomerular basement membrane), antimyeloperoxidase, antinuclear antibody, and Helicobacter pylori were all negative. C3, C4 normal, urinalysis: 2+ blood, no white blood cells or eosinophils, no casts, no albumin, negative for nitrate/leukocyte esterase and bacteria. Imaging: chest radiograph, abdominal radiograph, computed tomography of the abdomen, electrocardiography, and transthoracic echocardiography were all normal. Course. The patient's urine output declined from 700 to 400 cm(3)/d and the on third day he required hemodialysis with Cr 14 mg/dL. Renal biopsy showed typical findings of interstitial nephritis. The patient was dialyzed for 10 days and responded to steroids and went home with an improving Cr of 3.5 mg/dL, back to baseline of 1.5 in 8 weeks. Discussion. Internists encounter patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) on a daily basis, most of which can be explained by prerenal azotemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), obstruction, or rhabdomyolysis among other etiologies. Cocaine is only rarely implicated as an etiology of AKI and if it is, usually the injury is due to ATN or pigment effects. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) caused by cocaine, on the other hand, has only been described in a handful of cases. AIN is a renal lesion that causes a decline in creatinine clearance and is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate in the kidney interstitium and is most often associated with drug therapy. AIN can also be seen in autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, or sarcoidosis; or with infections remote to the kidney like Legionella, leptospirosis, and streptococcal disease. Our case was very similar to the other reported cases of AIN due to cocaine in that all have occurred in middle-aged African American males and all have responded to steroids. This case reminds clinicians to consider AIN in patients with AKI and a history of cocaine abuse.

Sarcoidosis within a pituitary adenoma. A 54 year old man presented with frontal headaches for one year. A CT scan of the head revealed a pituitary mass. He denied a change in vision or galactorrhea, but did have decreased frequency of erections and a recent episode of renal stones. On physical exam, the cranial nerves were normal. Visual field exam revealed mild bilateral temporal defects. The genitalia were normal and the testes were soft. Laboratory evaluation revealed: Na, 134 mM/l; K, 6.7 mM/l; Cl, 104 mM/l; HCO3, 22 mM/l; BUN, 47 mg/dl; Cr, 8.3 mg/dl; Ca, 12.5 mg/dl; Phos, 5.5 mg/dl; prolactin, 32.0 ng/ml; T4, 4.46 microg/dl; TSH, 2.07 microU/ml; LH, 18.1 mIU/ml; FSH 3.2 mIU/ml; alpha subunit 1.6 ng/ml; testosterone 255 ng/dl; cortisol, 20.3 microg/dl; cortisol after 250 microg cortrosyn, 38.5 microg/dl (time 60 minutes); growth hormone, 1.4 ng/ml; IGF-1, 47 ng/ml; PTH, &lt;1 pg/ml; 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 14 ng/ml; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 69 pg/ml. These results were felt to be consistent with a non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia, such as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, or a vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia, such as lymphoma, sarcoidosis or tuberculosis. Head MRI demonstrated a 3.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm heterogeneous mass enlarging the sella, deforming the clivus and compressing the cavernous sinus, basilar artery and left side of the optic chiasm. There was a small focus of high signal in the superior part of the mass on the T1-weighted image from either a proteinaceous cyst with early calcium deposition or sub-acute blood. These radiographic findings were felt to be consistent with a pituitary adenoma. The patient was treated with intravenous hydration and thyroxine 50 microg daily and underwent a transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion. Pathologic examination revealed a pituitary adenoma with multiple granulomas and crystalline material; this was consistent with sarcoid within the adenoma. Post-operatively, the serum LH fell to 5.5 mIU/ml. A subsequent transbronchial biopsy revealed multiple non-caseating granulomas. A serum ACE level was elevated at 132.6 U/l. He received oral prednisone 60 mg daily with resolution of the hypercalcemia. Neurosarcoidosis occurs in 5 to 15% of patients with sarcoidosis and can involve the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This is the first reported case of sarcoidosis occurring within a pituitary adenoma.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 37-year-old woman presented with increasing abdominal pain and jaundice. Six weeks before admission, she developed persistent diarrhea and jaundice of the skin. She also bruised easily, and her gums bled. In the subsequent weeks, her appetite decreased, she was fatigued, and she had nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. She had a history of drinking 1 quart of vodka every day for 20 years, with brief periods of abstinence; she stopped consuming alcohol 11 days before admission because it no longer provided symptomatic relief. Her past medical history was also notable for depression, including a suicide attempt 4 years earlier. She did not smoke, use illicit drugs, or have unprotected sexual intercourse. She had received no blood transfusions and had not traveled recently. She took no medications, except for occasional ibuprofen. On physical examination, she was thin and deeply jaundiced, and she trembled and responded slowly to questions. She was afebrile but tachypneic, and she had orthostatic hypotension. Her HEENT examination was notable for scleral and sublingual icterus, as well as crusted blood on her gums and teeth. The jugular veins were flat. The cardiac examination revealed tachycardia (heart rate, 103 beats per minute) without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was nontender and protuberant, with hypoactive bowel sounds; the spleen was not palpable, and there was no fluid wave or caput medusae. The liver percussed to 18 cm, with a smooth edge extending 10 cm below the costal margin. She had cutaneous telangiectases on her chest and bilateral palmar erythema. There was no peripheral edema. The neurologic examination was notable for asterixis. Her stool was guaiac positive. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: hematocrit, 21.2%; white blood cells, 17,310/mm(3); ammonia, 42 micromol/L; serum creatinine, 3.9 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 70 mg/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; total bilirubin, 26.8 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase, 14 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 77 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 138 U/L; prothrombin time, 103 seconds (international normalized ratio, 10.6); and urinary sodium, &lt;5 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed an elevated specific gravity and numerous muddy granular casts. Hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. On abdominal ultrasound examination, there was no ascites, and the liver was echogenic. The portal and hepatic veins were patent, and the hepatic arteries were normal. The spleen measured 14 cm. What is the diagnosis?


[Acute kidney failure in a recurrence of sarcoidosis at the height of summer]. A 35-year-old woman with sarcoidosis, successfully treated 3 years previously, developed fatigue, nausea and loss of weight during a summer holiday in Italy where she was exposed to much bright sun. There had been no previous recurrence of the sarcoidosis. On return she was found to be in renal failure with marked hypercalcaemia. Physical examination merely revealed peasized non-tender submandibular and cervical lymph nodes, but was otherwise unremarkable. Serum creatinine and calcium concentrations (3.8 mg/dl and 3.6 mmol/l) were markedly elevated. Computed tomography showed an enlarged submandibular lymph node, but no other organ abnormality. Biopsy of the salivary gland demonstrated recurrent sarcoidosis. Calcium concentration became normal (2.4 mmol/l) within two weeks of treatment with methylprednisolone (100 mg daily for 3 days, followed by gradual reduction to 30 mg daily for 3 months, until discontinued slowly). Creatinine concentration, which had fallen to 1.5 mg/dl, was at the upper limit of normal (1.1 mg/dl) after 4 months and 0.8 mg/dl after 8 months. Marked exposure to UV light should be avoided in patients with a history of recent sarcoidosis, because it increases the formation of vitamin D3 precursors: In the case of recurrent sarcoidosis, these precursors are converted to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the sarcoidosis granulomas. This can lead to severe complications, such as hypercalcaemia and renal failure.


Severe hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia in an adipsic young woman. Combined deficits in arginine vasopressin secretion (AVP) and thirst sensation can result in life threatening hyperosmolality and hypernatremia. Complications include seizures, profound volume contraction and renal failure. Fortunately, this is an uncommon clinical condition, with approximately 70 cases reported in the literature over the past 47 years [1]. Defects in AVP secretion and/or synthesis produce central diabetes insipidus (DI), polyuria with polydipsia, hypernatremia and hyperosmolality. Most awake and alert patients with an intact thirst stimulus will "drink" themselves back to a normal serum sodium and osmolality. However, if there is concomitant destruction of the osmoreceptors that regulate thirst, osmolal and volume homeostasis cannot be maintained. The relationships between urine osmolarity and serum osmolarity and plasma vasopressin levels are vital for distinguishing a reset osmostat from central DI. After obtaining approval from our institutional review board, we retrospectively reviewed the medical record of a 37-year-old patient who presented to our institution with a serum sodium of 176 mEq/l. Admission laboratory examination revealed: hemoglobin 12.8 g/dl; white blood cell count 4.7 Ã 103/Âµl, with a normal differential; random serum glucose 91 mg/dl ; sodium 176 mEq/l; plasma osmolality 366 mOsm/kg; BUN 33 mg/dl; serum creatinine 1 mg/dl; calcium 9.5 mg/dl; urine specific gravity 1.032; and urine osmolality 1,172 mOsm/kg. An MRI with contrast of the sella/ pituitary revealed an enhancing mass centered within the suprasellar cistern and anterior third ventricle, measuring 3.0 Ã 3.9 Ã 3.4 cm. The lesion appeared to involve the hypothalamus and displaced the optic chiasm inferiorly. Evaluation of pituitary function revealed normal serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, AM cortisol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between measured serum AVP levels and serum osmolality. Figure 2 shows the relationship between measured urine and serum osmolality. If the serum AVP levels were not available, it would appear as though the patient had a reset osmostat. The kidneys appear to appropriately generate maximally concentrated urine at a serum osmolality above 348 but are unable to below this value. When compared with the normal curve, our patient's AVP levels were lower than expected for the corresponding osmolality. This pattern is consistent with a partial central DI. She does not have a reset osmostat. In the presence of significant volume contraction and a reduced GFR, her kidneys produced more concentrated urine despite markedly decreased central vasopressin production. As the volume contraction abated and the GFR improved, polyuria recurred, despite persistent hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia.




Question:
A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic with complaints of constipation for the past 2 weeks. She reports that it has been getting increasingly difficult to pass stool to the point that she would go for 2-3 days without going to the bathroom. Prior to this, she passed stool every day without difficulty. She denies weight changes, headaches, chest pain, or abdominal pain but endorses fatigue. Her past medical history is significant for 2 episodes of kidney stones within the past 3 months. A physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are done and the results are shown below:

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 97 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L 
BUN: 10 mg/dL
Glucose: 103 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone: 3.1 uU/mL
Ca2+: 12.1 mg/dL
Phosphate: 1.2 mg/dL (Normal: 2.5-4.5 mg/dL)

What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s low phosphate levels?

[A] : Chronic renal disease caused by recurrent renal stones
[B] : Defective G-coupled calcium-sensing receptors in multiple tissues
[C] : Hereditary malfunction of phosphate absorption at the small brush border
[D] : Inhibition of sodium-phosphate cotransporter at the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)

Question:
A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of rectal bleeding. He describes blood mixed in with the stool, which is associated with a change in his normal bowel habit such that he is going more frequently than normal. He also has some crampy left-sided abdominal pain and weight loss. His symptoms started 2 months ago, but he thought they are due to lack of dietary fiber intake and excess consumption of red meat. He has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 35 years for which he takes metformin. He also uses daily low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection and occasional naproxen for knee pain. His family history is irrelevant. On examination, his abdomen and digital rectal examination are normal. Colonoscopy shows an ulcerating mucosal lesion with a narrow bowel lumen and biopsy shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the greatest risk factor for colorectal cancer in this patient?

We report the case of a 72-year-old man who presented with weight loss, anorexia and a change in bowel habit. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated widespread thoracic and abdominal lymphadenopathy and a lesion within the splenic flexure. This was confirmed  as an adenocarcinoma after a colonoscopic biopsy. A CT guided biopsy of the abdominal lymph node confirmed the adenocarcinoma. Within three days of admission, the patient developed worsening, progressive cerebellar symptoms that left the patient aphasic and bed bound. CT of the head was reported  as normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated widespread leptomeningeal metastases. We describe a case of isolated leptomeningeal metastasis from a colorectal primary tumour.

Early diagnosis improves survival in colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer in the UK. Common alarm symptoms include rectal bleeding, change in bowel habit and iron deficiency anaemia. Abdominal mass, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, anorexia and abdominal swelling are less common presenting symptoms. Patients meeting the NICE criteria for urgent referral should be referred via the two week wait pathway to the local colorectal department for prompt assessment to exclude colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer has a male predominance and is strongly associated with age; 80% of new cases occur in patients aged over 60. Obesity and limited exercise are strong risk factors. Diets low in fruit and vegetables and fibre and high in red meat have also been associated with an increased risk. Patients with one first-degree relative under 45 or two first-degree relatives of any age have an approximate lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer of 16-25% in men and 10-15% in women. Having one first-degree relative who developed the disease after the age of 65 barely increases lifetime risk. Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis also have an increased lifetime risk of colorectal cancer. In the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, patients are screened with a faecal occult blood test which they complete at home and return by post. Patients with positive tests are then offered further investigation, typically colonoscopy. The sensitivity of colonoscopy for detecting abnormalities is &gt; 90% and hence it is the gold standard test for evaluating the large bowel. Once a diagnosis of colorectal cancer has been confirmed, the extent of disease is evaluated by a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

Enterobiasis-related inflammatory caecal polyp masquerading as a malignancy. A 55 -year-old Asian man was seen in the emergency department with bleeding per rectum. He was a teetotaller and had no previous abdominal surgery. He did, however, report a change in bowel habit towards constipation. He underwent colonoscopy which revealed a lesion, highly suspicious of malignancy, in the caecum. On review by two consultants, a decision to completely resect this lesion was made. Histological analysis of the polypoidal growth showed it to be a consequence of chronic infection with the helminth Enterobius vermicularis. Importantly, there was no evidence of dysplastic or malignant cells. The patient was subsequently discharged with a 3-day course of antihelminthic mebendazole and reassured that his per rectal bleeding was most likely due to haemorrhoids discovered at rectal examination.

Identifying patients with suspected colorectal cancer in primary care: derivation and validation of an algorithm. Earlier diagnosis of colorectal cancer could help improve survival so better tools are needed to help this. To derive and validate an algorithm to quantify the absolute risk of colorectal cancer in patients in primary care with and without symptoms. Cohort study using data from 375 UK QResearchÂ® general practices for development and 189 for validation. Included patients were aged 30-84 years, free at baseline from a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and without rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, appetite loss, or weight loss in the previous 12 months. The primary outcome was incident diagnosis of colorectal cancer recorded in the next 2 years. Risk factors examined were age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol status, deprivation, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, family history of gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal polyp, history of another cancer, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, appetite loss, weight loss, diarrhoea, constipation, change of bowel habit, tiredness, and anaemia. Cox proportional hazards models were used to develop separate risk equations in males and females. Measures of calibration and discrimination assessed performance in the validation cohort. There were 4798 incident cases of colorectal cancer from 4.1 million person-years in the derivation cohort. Independent predictors in males and females included family history of gastrointestinal cancer, anaemia, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, appetite loss, and weight loss. Alcohol consumption and recent change in bowel habit were also predictors in males. On validation, the algorithms explained 65% of the variation in females and 67% in males. The receiver operating curve statistics were 0.89 (females) and 0.91 (males). The D statistic was 2.8 (females) and 2.9 (males). The 10% of patients with the highest predicted risks contained 71% of all colorectal cancers diagnosed over the next 2 years. The algorithm has good discrimination and calibration and could potentially be used to help identify those at highest risk of current colorectal cancer, to facilitate early referral and investigation.

Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura in an older man presenting as rectal bleeding and IgA mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis: a case report. Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura is the most common systemic vasculitis in children. Typical presentations are palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis, and hematuria. This vasculitic syndrome can present as an uncommon cause of rectal bleeding in older patients. We report a case of an older man with Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura. He presented with rectal bleeding and acute kidney injury secondary to IgA mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. A 75-year-old Polish man with a history of diverticulosis presented with a five-day history of rectal bleeding. He had first noticed colicky left lower abdominal pain two months previously. At that time he was treated with a 10-day course of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for possible diverticulitis. He subsequently presented with rectal bleeding to our emergency department. Physical examination revealed generalized palpable purpuric rash and tenderness on his left lower abdomen. Laboratory testing showed a mildly elevated serum creatinine of 1.3. Computed tomography of his abdomen revealed a diffusely edematous and thickened sigmoid colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed severe petechiae throughout the colon. Colonic biopsy showed small vessel acute inflammation. Skin biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Due to worsening kidney function, microscopic hematuria and new onset proteinuria, he underwent a kidney biopsy which demonstrated IgA mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. A diagnosis of Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura was made. Intravenous methylprednisolone was initially started and transitioned to prednisone tapering orally to complete six months of therapy. There was marked improvement of abdominal pain. Skin lesions gradually faded and gastrointestinal bleeding stopped. Acute kidney injury also improved. Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, an uncommon vasculitic syndrome in older patients, can present with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, extensive skin lesions and renal involvement which responds well to systemic steroid therapy. A history of diverticulosis can mislead physicians to the diagnosis of diverticular bleeding which is more common in this age group. The clinical manifestations of the disease, including characteristic skin rash, abdominal pain, joint inflammation and renal involvement raised the suspicious of Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura.

The patient was subsequently discharged with a 3-day course of antihelminthic mebendazole and reassured that his per rectal bleeding was most likely due to haemorrhoids discovered at rectal examination.




Question:
A 72-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of rectal bleeding. He describes blood mixed in with the stool, which is associated with a change in his normal bowel habit such that he is going more frequently than normal. He also has some crampy left-sided abdominal pain and weight loss. His symptoms started 2 months ago, but he thought they are due to lack of dietary fiber intake and excess consumption of red meat. He has had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 35 years for which he takes metformin. He also uses daily low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection and occasional naproxen for knee pain. His family history is irrelevant. On examination, his abdomen and digital rectal examination are normal. Colonoscopy shows an ulcerating mucosal lesion with a narrow bowel lumen and biopsy shows a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the greatest risk factor for colorectal cancer in this patient?

[A] : Lack of dietary fiber intake
[B] : Increasing age
[C] : Low-dose aspirin use
[D] : Naproxen use

A 26-year-old HIV-negative male presented with a persistent high-grade fever of two months duration to the Leishmaniasis Research and Treatment Center of University of Gondar Hospital. He was anorexic and had lost significant weight (from 76 to 57âkg in 4 months, BMI = 17.2âkg/m(2)). He also complained of headache, chills, and rigor. In the last one year, he was experiencing a few episodes of acute bloody diarrhea, the last episode being two months ago. Microscopy from splenic aspiration showed Leishman-Donovan bodies with parasite load of +3. The blood culture showed Shigella species, but the stool was culture negative. The isolate was sensitive to most tested antibiotic discs, sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, tetracycline, and norfloxacilin, except ampicillin. Therefore, requesting blood culture for identifying unexpected type of organisms causing infections in patients with underlying diseases like visceral leishmaniasis should be encouraged.

Pediatric Covid-19 mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia associated intussusception: A case report and literature review. A 2 month old, full term, previously healthy male, with known COVID-19 infection 3 weeks prior to arrival presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of 5-6 episodes of non-bilious and non-bloody emesis. According to the child's parents, the emesis was mostly associated with feeding. His parents endorsed that the patient had one episode of diarrhea that was maroon in color and appeared different than typical stools. Abdominal exam at that time was non distended with no tenderness and no other significant findings. The patient was observed while feeding in the ED and was noted to have some minimal spit up with arching of his back. A presumptive diagnosis of reflux was made, and the patient was discharged home with education on feeding. The infant was brought back to the ED the following day due to worsening emesis. Additionally, his parents noted more episodes of bloody stools. His abdomen appeared mildly distended with moderate tenderness on abdominal examination. During evaluation, a large "currant jelly" stool was observed (Fig. 1). An abdominal ultrasound was obtained, which demonstrated an ileocolic intussusception with a possible enlarged lymph node as lead point. The patient received an air contrast enema with successful reduction. Repeat ultrasound was obtained which confirmed resolution, and the patient was admitted for overnight observation. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction testing. He was discharged the following day after successful advancing of diet, normal serial abdominal exams, and observed normal bowel movements.

Case 250: Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome. History A 10-year-old girl with global developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was transferred from an outside hospital because of confusion and multiple episodes of left face and arm jerking. Physical examination revealed normal muscle bulk, strength, and tone in the bilateral upper and lower extremities but insuppressible left arm and jaw twitching Lumbar puncture revealed no white or red blood cells, a normal glucose level of 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (normal range, 50-80 mg/dL [2.8-4.4 mmol/L]), and an elevated protein level of 81.6 mg/dL (normal range, 15-60 mg/100 dL). A comprehensive metabolic panel revealed lactic acidosis. The patient was initially started on levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate for status epilepticus. Hepatic dysfunction was not present at initial admission but developed 2 months later, with an alanine aminotransferase level of 90-406 U/L (1.5-6.8 Î¼kat/L) (normal range, 8-37 U/L [0.13-0.62 Î¼kat/L]) and aspartate aminotransferase in the range of 75-187 U/L (1.2-3.1 Î¼kat/L) (normal range, 8-35 U/L [0.13-0.58 Î¼kat/L]). Electroencephalography revealed right parietal and occipital spike-and-wave discharges, with bursts of up to 20 seconds, which were indicative of subclinical status epilepticus. The family history was remarkable for a sister with head lag, developmental delay, seizure disorder, and liver failure.

[A case of 21-hydroxylase deficiency and Bartter's syndrome associated with a balanced 6-9 translocation]. A 17-year-old female weighing 37 kg and 140 cm in height was referred to our hospital for evaluation of dwarfism and primary amenorrhea. She was delivered with 3350 g in weight and 50 cm in height after a ten month pregnancy without complications. No abnormal findings were revealed in physical appearance except critomegaly. Episodes of nausea, vomiting and dehydration were rare throughout her childhood, but she had a tendency to salt craving. At the age of 14, her height was 140 cm. On admission, her physical development was markedly retarded for her age, except external genitalia. Diffuse pigmentations on the trunk and extremities were observed. Her blood pressure was normal (112/62 mm Hg). Serum potassium concentration was 2.9 mEq/L. Arterial-blood gas analysis revealed metabolic alkalosis. Both of renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) in plasma at rest were markedly elevated to 15.5 ng/ml/h and 107.1 ng/dl, respectively. The plasma concentrations of pregnenolone (1449 ng/dl), progesterone (178 ng/dl), 17-OH-pregnenolone (1613 ng/dl), 17-OH-progesterone (180 ng/dl), dehydroepiandrosterone (3706 ng/dl), androstendione (824.6 ng/dl) and testosterone (900 ng/dl) were high, whereas deoxycorticosterone (15.7 ng/dl), corticosterone (0.65 microgram/dl) and cortisol (6.8 micrograms/dl) were within normal limits. Urinary 17-KS excretion showed high levels between 65.7 and 109.4 mg/day, while urinary 17-OHCS excretion was normal (5.7-7.0 mg/day). Vascular response to angiotensin II (A-II) was attenuated. Distal fractional chloride reabsorption was decreased (CH2O/CH2O+CCl = 0.62, normal: 0.92 +/- 0.04). Moderate hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells was demonstrated in biopsy specimen of the kidney. Cytogenetic studies showed a 46, XX chromosome constitution with translocation of the long arm of chromosome 6 to the short arm of chromosome 9. Her mother as well as younger brother and sister, whose electrolytes and arterial-blood gas analysis showed normal values, had chromosomes with the same translocation. Treatment with dexamethasone (2 mg/day) reduced every adrenal steroids to normal range, but PRA and PAC remained high levels. Furthermore, neither hypokalemic alkalosis nor vasoreactivity to exogenous A-II was improved. Indomethacin (75 mg/day) decreased urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 from a high level of 738.4 ng/day to 433.4 ng/day and normalized metabolic alkalosis. Vascular response to A-II was moderately improved. However, serum potassium remained low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

At the age of 4 mo, he was diagnosed as having CNDI, judging from fever with hypernatremia (serum Na 153 mEq/L), diluted urine (urine osmolarity 193 mOsm/kg), high antidiuretic hormone (plasma antidiuretic hormone 53 pg/mL), and normal renal function (serum creatinine 0.3 mg/dL). His length and weight were mean +0.4 and -1.1 SD, respectively, at that time. He was treated with sodium restriction (sodium intake; 0.53 mEq/kg/day) using low sodium formula in addition to trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, and mefenamic acid. Growth failure developed: his length and weight were mean -2.4 and -3.3 SD, respectively, at the age of 10 mo. After withdrawal of sodium restriction to 1.5 mEq/kg/day of sodium intake without any change of caloric intake and medication, catch-up growth was observed. At the age of 39 mo, the patient's height and weight were mean -0.8 and -0.6 SD, respectively. We conclude that excessive sodium restriction can cause growth failure in infants with CNDI.




Question:
A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for the evaluation of delay in attaining developmental milestones. He could sit upright by 14 months and has not been able to walk without support. He can build a tower of 3 blocks and cannot use utensils to feed himself. He speaks in unclear 2-word phrases and cannot draw a circle yet. His mother has noticed him hitting his head against the wall on multiple occasions. He is at 20th percentile for height and at 50th percentile for weight. Vitals signs are within normal limits. Examination shows multiple lacerations of his lips and tongue. There are multiple healing wounds over his fingers. Neurological examination shows increased muscle tone in all extremities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL

Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency with elevated sweat chloride test: report of a case. A 15-month-old girl with severe hemolytic anemia and progressive respiratory failure is presented. She was well until the age of six months when she developed a pulmonary infection. During the next six months, she had frequent respiratory infections and her paleness became evident. At the age of 12 months, she was observed to have easy fatigability and muscle weakness, and she received her first blood transfusion. She was referred to our hospital at the age of 15 months. The physical examination revealed a malnourished girl with hypotonia, nystagmus, generalized muscle weakness and severe breathing difficulty requiring ventilatory support The hemoglobin (Hb) was 9.7 g/dl; hematocrit (Hct) 29%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 101 fl and reticulocyte count 15%. Peripheral blood smear revealed macrocytosis and stomatocytosis (30% of the red cells) and polychromasia. Sweat chloride test was 90 and 94 mEq/L on two separate occasions. The serum vitamin E level was 0.26 mg/dl (N: 0.44-0.68). She was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation. Although malnutrition, low serum vitamin E and elevated sweat chloride test were suggestive of cystic fibrosis, this diagnosis failed to account for all the findings in the patient. A search for a red cell enzyme deficiency revealed that the red cell triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) activity was low. DNA analysis showed the 315 G-C (105 Glu-Asp) TPI mutation, thus confirming the diagnosis of TPI deficiency.

Renal parameters during infancy. In a prospective study we estimated common renal parameters in 48 full term normal neonates, of which 15 were also tested at 6 months and 12 months of age. The mean levels of serum creatinine, were high at birth (0.73 mg/dl) but normal for age at 6 and 12 months; uric acid followed a similar trend. The blood pH and bicarbonate were low at birth (7.28 and 20.36 mEq/L, respectively) reached normal adult values by 12 months; chloride levels were high at birth (110 +/- 5 mEq/L) and normal at 6 months. The plasma renin activity was higher than normal all throughout the first year (27.1, 416.8, 64.8 ng/ml/hr by RIA). Plasma aldosterone values were high at birth (1387.5 pg/ml) and reached normal level (301.6) at 12 months. Renal length and volume as assessed by ultrasonography compared well with American standards. Urinary constituents were variable due to breast feeding up to 6 months and varied diet during the weaning period. This study shows that mild metabolic acidosis and hyperchloremia due to immaturity of renal acidification mechanism and high renin and aldosterone levels due to partial nonresponsiveness of distal tubules are normal variables in babies from birth to 6 months. The levels of serum creatinine and uric acid are high at birth and in assessing renal functions this should be borne in mind.

Case 250: Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome. History A 10-year-old girl with global developmental delay and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was transferred from an outside hospital because of confusion and multiple episodes of left face and arm jerking. Physical examination revealed normal muscle bulk, strength, and tone in the bilateral upper and lower extremities but insuppressible left arm and jaw twitching Lumbar puncture revealed no white or red blood cells, a normal glucose level of 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (normal range, 50-80 mg/dL [2.8-4.4 mmol/L]), and an elevated protein level of 81.6 mg/dL (normal range, 15-60 mg/100 dL). A comprehensive metabolic panel revealed lactic acidosis. The patient was initially started on levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate for status epilepticus. Hepatic dysfunction was not present at initial admission but developed 2 months later, with an alanine aminotransferase level of 90-406 U/L (1.5-6.8 Î¼kat/L) (normal range, 8-37 U/L [0.13-0.62 Î¼kat/L]) and aspartate aminotransferase in the range of 75-187 U/L (1.2-3.1 Î¼kat/L) (normal range, 8-35 U/L [0.13-0.58 Î¼kat/L]). Electroencephalography revealed right parietal and occipital spike-and-wave discharges, with bursts of up to 20 seconds, which were indicative of subclinical status epilepticus. The family history was remarkable for a sister with head lag, developmental delay, seizure disorder, and liver failure.


[A case of 21-hydroxylase deficiency and Bartter's syndrome associated with a balanced 6-9 translocation]. A 17-year-old female weighing 37 kg and 140 cm in height was referred to our hospital for evaluation of dwarfism and primary amenorrhea. She was delivered with 3350 g in weight and 50 cm in height after a ten month pregnancy without complications. No abnormal findings were revealed in physical appearance except critomegaly. Episodes of nausea, vomiting and dehydration were rare throughout her childhood, but she had a tendency to salt craving. At the age of 14, her height was 140 cm. On admission, her physical development was markedly retarded for her age, except external genitalia. Diffuse pigmentations on the trunk and extremities were observed. Her blood pressure was normal (112/62 mm Hg). Serum potassium concentration was 2.9 mEq/L. Arterial-blood gas analysis revealed metabolic alkalosis. Both of renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone concentration (PAC) in plasma at rest were markedly elevated to 15.5 ng/ml/h and 107.1 ng/dl, respectively. The plasma concentrations of pregnenolone (1449 ng/dl), progesterone (178 ng/dl), 17-OH-pregnenolone (1613 ng/dl), 17-OH-progesterone (180 ng/dl), dehydroepiandrosterone (3706 ng/dl), androstendione (824.6 ng/dl) and testosterone (900 ng/dl) were high, whereas deoxycorticosterone (15.7 ng/dl), corticosterone (0.65 microgram/dl) and cortisol (6.8 micrograms/dl) were within normal limits. Urinary 17-KS excretion showed high levels between 65.7 and 109.4 mg/day, while urinary 17-OHCS excretion was normal (5.7-7.0 mg/day). Vascular response to angiotensin II (A-II) was attenuated. Distal fractional chloride reabsorption was decreased (CH2O/CH2O+CCl = 0.62, normal: 0.92 +/- 0.04). Moderate hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular cells was demonstrated in biopsy specimen of the kidney. Cytogenetic studies showed a 46, XX chromosome constitution with translocation of the long arm of chromosome 6 to the short arm of chromosome 9. Her mother as well as younger brother and sister, whose electrolytes and arterial-blood gas analysis showed normal values, had chromosomes with the same translocation. Treatment with dexamethasone (2 mg/day) reduced every adrenal steroids to normal range, but PRA and PAC remained high levels. Furthermore, neither hypokalemic alkalosis nor vasoreactivity to exogenous A-II was improved. Indomethacin (75 mg/day) decreased urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 from a high level of 738.4 ng/day to 433.4 ng/day and normalized metabolic alkalosis. Vascular response to A-II was moderately improved. However, serum potassium remained low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Growth failure in an infant with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus during sodium restriction. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is an inherited disorder characterized by renal tubular insensitivity to antidiuretic hormone, resulting in an inability to concentrate urine. We report on an infant boy with CNDI who showed growth failure during treatment with sodium restriction. At the age of 4 mo, he was diagnosed as having CNDI, judging from fever with hypernatremia (serum Na 153 mEq/L), diluted urine (urine osmolarity 193 mOsm/kg), high antidiuretic hormone (plasma antidiuretic hormone 53 pg/mL), and normal renal function (serum creatinine 0.3 mg/dL). His length and weight were mean +0.4 and -1.1 SD, respectively, at that time. He was treated with sodium restriction (sodium intake; 0.53 mEq/kg/day) using low sodium formula in addition to trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, and mefenamic acid. Growth failure developed: his length and weight were mean -2.4 and -3.3 SD, respectively, at the age of 10 mo. After withdrawal of sodium restriction to 1.5 mEq/kg/day of sodium intake without any change of caloric intake and medication, catch-up growth was observed. At the age of 39 mo, the patient's height and weight were mean -0.8 and -0.6 SD, respectively. We conclude that excessive sodium restriction can cause growth failure in infants with CNDI.

Presenting symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease: descriptive analysis of a community-based inception cohort. Few data are currently available on the initial presenting symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated the initial symptom presentation of patients with IBD in the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), a community-based inception cohort that enrolled Rhode Island IBD patients at time of diagnosis with longitudinal follow up. A 41-question symptom inventory was administered at time of enrollment to capture symptoms experienced during the 4âweeks preceding diagnosis of IBD. Frequencies of presenting symptoms were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) with promax rotation was used to examine possible symptom profiles among Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, respectively. Using the Scree plot, the 4-component solution was found to be optimal for both CD and UC. A total of 233 CD and 150 UC patients were included. The most common presenting symptoms in CD were tiredness/fatigue (80.6%) and abdominal pain (80.4%) while passage of blood with bowel movements (BM) (86.6%) and loose/watery BMs (86.5%) were most common in UC. The 5 symptoms with greatest differences between UC and CD were passage of blood with BM (UC 86.6%/CD 45.3%), urgent BM (UC 82.5%/CD 63.9%), passage of mucus with BM (UC 67.7%/CD 36.9%), passage of blood from the anus (UC 59.7%/CD 32.1%), and anxiety about distance from bathroom (UC 59%/CD 38.7%). The PCA analysis yielded a 4 symptom components solution for CD and UC. The most common presenting symptoms in CD are fatigue and abdominal pain while in UC bloody BM and diarrhea are most common. Distinct symptom phenotypes are seen with PCA analysis. Our study demonstrates symptomatic similarities and differences between CD and UC and suggests that patients may also be classified by symptom phenotype at time of diagnosis.

Capillariasis: chronic watery diarrhea--not only from microorganisms. A 54-year-old male Thai patient from Prachin Buri Province presented with a history of chronic watery diarrhea for many years. He passed stool five to ten times per day with occasionally colicky pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. He had visited hospitals and private clinics and received treatment but with no improvement. He presented to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand, where on physical examination, he had moderate dehydration, weakness, abdominal distension and a gurgling abdomen. The eggs, larvae and adult worms of Capillaria philippinensis were found on stool examination. The patient was admitted and treated with Mebendazole for 20 days, whereupon his symptoms resolved. Two months previously, he had ingested a raw small fresh-water fish dish called "Phra-Pla Siw/Soi". Small fresh-water fish near the patient's home were collected and examined for Capillaria philippinensis larva. The results were negative for parasitic organisms.

Presenting symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease: descriptive analysis of a community-based inception cohort. Few data are currently available on the initial presenting symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated the initial symptom presentation of patients with IBD in the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), a community-based inception cohort that enrolled Rhode Island IBD patients at time of diagnosis with longitudinal follow up. A 41-question symptom inventory was administered at time of enrollment to capture symptoms experienced during the 4âweeks preceding diagnosis of IBD. Frequencies of presenting symptoms were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) with promax rotation was used to examine possible symptom profiles among Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, respectively. Using the Scree plot, the 4-component solution was found to be optimal for both CD and UC. A total of 233 CD and 150 UC patients were included. The most common presenting symptoms in CD were tiredness/fatigue (80.6%) and abdominal pain (80.4%) while passage of blood with bowel movements (BM) (86.6%) and loose/watery BMs (86.5%) were most common in UC. The 5 symptoms with greatest differences between UC and CD were passage of blood with BM (UC 86.6%/CD 45.3%), urgent BM (UC 82.5%/CD 63.9%), passage of mucus with BM (UC 67.7%/CD 36.9%), passage of blood from the anus (UC 59.7%/CD 32.1%), and anxiety about distance from bathroom (UC 59%/CD 38.7%). The PCA analysis yielded a 4 symptom components solution for CD and UC. The most common presenting symptoms in CD are fatigue and abdominal pain while in UC bloody BM and diarrhea are most common. Distinct symptom phenotypes are seen with PCA analysis. Our study demonstrates symptomatic similarities and differences between CD and UC and suggests that patients may also be classified by symptom phenotype at time of diagnosis.

Electrocorticogram changes during corpus callosotomy for uncontrolled symptomatic generalized epilepsy. We report a 19-year-old man who presented to our facility with medically intractable, symptomatic generalized epilepsy manifesting as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs). Before he underwent an anterior callosotomy (6 cm), these seizures, which he had experienced for 11 years, seemed to have a left-sided focal origin. Intraoperatively, no epileptiform discharges were found on the electrocorticogram (ECoG) performed prior to sectioning, but more than 10 left-sided seizures were recorded after sectioning. In the 10 years since surgery, the patient's seizures have remained generalized; however, the frequency and severity of the seizures have decreased. These findings indicate that the presence of electrocorticographic seizures, as measured by ECoG immediately following callosotomy, may not predict a poor surgical outcome, even though such a finding might be indicative of epileptogenicity in general.

Precipitating factors and therapeutic outcome in epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of precipitating factors and therapy on the outcome of epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Retrospective analysis of data from 34 patients (mean age at seizure onset 19 years; mean duration of follow-up 9.2 years) suffering from epilepsy of either cryptogenic or remote symptomatic (n = 19), or idiopathic (n = 15) etiology. The total number of seizures in all patients was 146. Without treatment 97 seizures manifested during 90.5 years without treatment (1.07 seizures/year), during treatment with carbamazepine or valproate 49 seizures occurred within 224 years (0.2 seizures/year). The frequency of seizures was significantly lower during treatment. Precipitating factors were found in relation to 31% of seizures in patients with remote symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy, and for 51% of seizures in patients with idiopathic epilepsy. There was a low frequency of seizures in patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Precipitating factors are common. Antiepileptic drug treatment is effective.

The adolescent or adult with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Primary and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs) together constitute up to 50% of adolescent and adult patients with epilepsy as diagnosed by history and EEG. Syncope and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are major differential diagnoses and must be carefully excluded in therapy-resistant cases. Individual episodes can have up to seven phases in secondarily generalized GTCs. The distinction between primary and secondary GTCs depends mainly on history and EEG, and yield can be improved with sleep deprivation or overnight recording. Epilepsies with primary or unclassified GTCs can respond to any one of the five broad-spectrum antiepileptic drugs (AEDs): valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate and zonisamide. Unless a focal onset is clearly confirmed, a sodium-channel blocking AED should not be used in the initial treatment of these conditions.

Generalized tonic-clonic seizures with post-ictal atrial fibrillation. Convulsive seizures are known to cause severe cardiopulmonary changes and increased autonomic activity. Limited reports describe peri-ictal cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). We present a unique case of a healthy 23-year-old male patient with new onset prolonged AF in the setting of new onset seizures, occurring on three independent occasions. Over two years, our patient had multiple hospitalizations for seizures with an electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis of AF made on three different occasions, occurring during his post-ictal state (all within 30â¯min of seizure onset). These seizures were never captured by electroencephalography (EEG) or witnessed by the medical staff, but were reported by family and/or reviewed on video provided by them. After his first GTCS, his AF persisted and was medically cardioverted. Two additional instances of AF after witnessed GTCS have been captured. After his second unprovoked seizure, an anti-seizure drug (ASD) was prescribed. A multi-disciplinary approach may be adopted to address comorbidities associated with seizures. Aggressive evaluation and treatment should be employed for newly diagnosed and refractory seizure patients associated with arrhythmias, in our case AF. Peri-ictal arrhythmias may be considered a potential marker for increased sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk.

[Partial benign crises in adolescence]. The aim of this paper is to present the case of teenage patient with partial seizures fulfilling the criteria of benign partial seizures of adolescence. A 16-year-old male patient had two seizures with a sensory-motor "march" that evolved into a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure on the same day. Several weeks before this event he had had several simple partial sensory seizures. The patient had no previous history of seizures and there was no family history of epilepsy. The neurological examination, EEG and magnetic resonance imaging were normal. The patient was treated with antiepileptic monotherapy during two years. The treatment was gradually tapered and withdrawn over the following six months. He has had no recurrences during the five years of follow-up. The early diagnosis of this entity has the significant prognostic and therapeutic repercussions.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. Diagnosis: P. carinii pneumonia and primary pulmonary sporotrichosis. PRESENTING FEATURES: A 53-year-old man who had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a 3-month history of increasing dysphagia, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and an episode of syncope. His past medical history was notable for oral and presumptive esophageal candidiasis that was treated with fluconazole 6 months prior to presentation. Three months prior to presentation, he discontinued his medications, and his symptoms of dysphagia recurred. During that time he developed intermittent fevers and chills, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, and a cough productive of white sputum. He also reported a 40-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. On the day prior to presentation, he had chest pain and shortness of breath followed by weakness, dizziness, and a brief syncopal episode. He denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, jaundice, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea. There was no history of alcohol use, and he stopped smoking tobacco approximately 1 month previously. He smoked cocaine but denied injection drug use. The patient had never been on antiretroviral therapy and had never had his CD4 count or viral load measured. On physical examination, the patient was a thin, cachectic man who appeared older than his stated age. His vital signs were notable for blood pressure of 102/69 mm Hg, resting tachycardia of 102 beats per minute, resting oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, normal resting respiratory rate, and a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His oropharynx was clear, with no signs of thrush or mucosal ulcers. His pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. His skin was intact, with no visible petechiae, rashes, nodules, or ulcers. Laboratory studies showed a total white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10(3)/microL, with a total lymphocyte count of 330/microL, hematocrit of 30.2%, a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 219 IU/L. The patient had an absolute CD4 count of 8 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 86,457 copies/mL. His arterial blood gas on room air had a pH of 7.51, a PCO2 of 33 mm Hg, and a PO2 of 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram and serial serum cardiac enzymes were normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral upper lobe patchy infiltrates with left upper lobe consolidation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with contrast showed bilateral ground glass infiltrates with focal consolidation (Figure 1) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Induced sputum was negative for Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, or acid-fast bacilli. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. What is the diagnosis?

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. PRESENTING FEATURES: An 18-year-old white man was admitted to the Osler Medical Service with the chief complaint of back pain. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient developed diffuse and aching upper back pain. Over the next couple of days, he also developed severe anterior chest pain that was somewhat pleuritic in nature but diffuse and extending bilaterally into the shoulders. One week prior to admission, he developed intermittent fevers and night sweats. The patient denied any lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, sick contacts, shortness of breath, rash, or bleeding. He was seen by a physician and told that he had thrombocytopenia. There was no history of recent or remote unusual bleeding episodes. His medical history was unremarkable except for a childhood diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. He was not taking any medications and had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Physical examination showed that he was afebrile and had normal vital signs. He was a well-appearing man who was lying still because of pain. HEENT examination was unremarkable. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudates. His lungs were clear. His neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy. Examination of his back and chest revealed no focal tenderness. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and his skin was without petechiae or rashes. Examination of the patient's joints showed pain on passive and active movement of his shoulders bilaterally, but no frank arthritis. There was no rash, petechiae, or echymoses. Chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were unremarkable. On admission, the laboratory examination was notable for a hematocrit level of 32.5%, with a mean corpuscular volume of 79 fL, and white blood cell count of 2.8 x 10(3)/microL. Platelet count was 75 x 10(3)/microL. A white blood cell differential revealed 7% bands, 53% polys, 34% lymphs, 5% atypical lymphocytes, 2% nucleated red cells, and a few young unidentified cells.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 37-year-old woman presented with increasing abdominal pain and jaundice. Six weeks before admission, she developed persistent diarrhea and jaundice of the skin. She also bruised easily, and her gums bled. In the subsequent weeks, her appetite decreased, she was fatigued, and she had nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. She had a history of drinking 1 quart of vodka every day for 20 years, with brief periods of abstinence; she stopped consuming alcohol 11 days before admission because it no longer provided symptomatic relief. Her past medical history was also notable for depression, including a suicide attempt 4 years earlier. She did not smoke, use illicit drugs, or have unprotected sexual intercourse. She had received no blood transfusions and had not traveled recently. She took no medications, except for occasional ibuprofen. On physical examination, she was thin and deeply jaundiced, and she trembled and responded slowly to questions. She was afebrile but tachypneic, and she had orthostatic hypotension. Her HEENT examination was notable for scleral and sublingual icterus, as well as crusted blood on her gums and teeth. The jugular veins were flat. The cardiac examination revealed tachycardia (heart rate, 103 beats per minute) without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was nontender and protuberant, with hypoactive bowel sounds; the spleen was not palpable, and there was no fluid wave or caput medusae. The liver percussed to 18 cm, with a smooth edge extending 10 cm below the costal margin. She had cutaneous telangiectases on her chest and bilateral palmar erythema. There was no peripheral edema. The neurologic examination was notable for asterixis. Her stool was guaiac positive. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: hematocrit, 21.2%; white blood cells, 17,310/mm(3); ammonia, 42 micromol/L; serum creatinine, 3.9 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 70 mg/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; total bilirubin, 26.8 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase, 14 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 77 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 138 U/L; prothrombin time, 103 seconds (international normalized ratio, 10.6); and urinary sodium, &lt;5 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed an elevated specific gravity and numerous muddy granular casts. Hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. On abdominal ultrasound examination, there was no ascites, and the liver was echogenic. The portal and hepatic veins were patent, and the hepatic arteries were normal. The spleen measured 14 cm. What is the diagnosis?

[Peripheral neuropathy and dysautonomia in a patient with primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome]. A 46 year-old female presented with dry eyes and a dry mouth which she had been experiencing for about 15 years. She also began to notice dizziness (orthostatic hypotension) during the last 5 years. The symptoms gradually increased whereupon she began to have polyarthralgia, facial flashing, hyper and hyposweating in some areas on the face and trunk. Her sialography showed a damaged parotid gland. Minor salivary gland biopsy revealed chronic sialoadenitis. The Sirmer test was low, and the Rosebengal test indicated keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Her serological tests showed hypocomplementemia and were positive for antinuclear antibody and SS-A antibody. The diagnosis of primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SjS) was made based on these findings. Prednisolone, at a dose of 15 mg per day, was given orally. As a result of this therapy, arthralgia disappeared immediately, although it had no effect on the neuropathy found in this patient. This is a rare case of SjS associated with peripheral neuropathy and severe dysautonomia.

Practical guidelines for the early diagnosis of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome in primary healthcare. Primary care physicians can play a crucial role by recognising SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SS) in the early stages identifying those patients with the greatest probability of being diagnosed with SS. SS has a very specific epidemiological profile at presentation (female aged 30-50 years), which may aid an early diagnosis. Although the disease may be expressed in many guises, there are three predominant clinical presentations that should be considered as key clues to increased clinical suspicion (multiple symptoms of dryness, asthenia-polyalgia syndrome and systemic organ-specific manifestations). The physical examination may provide important clues to systemic involvement (parotid gland enlargement, skin lesions suggestive of purpura or annular erythema, respiratory crackles, arthritis, neurological sensory or motor deficits). Simple laboratory studies may be very useful in reinforcing the clinical suspicion of SS, and the triad of cytopenia, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high serum gamma globulin levels is a very specific "biological" pattern suggesting SS. A solid clinical suspicion of SS requires both the patient reporting sicca symptoms and objective evidence that these symptoms are associated with dysfunction of the lachrymal and salivary glands. Ultrasonography of the parotid glands, a non-invasive method, may be a major advance in the diagnostic approach to SS in primary care. Primary care physicians must be considered essential members of the multidisciplinary team in charge of the follow-up of SS patients, due to their key role in the continuum of patient care and their cross-sectional knowledge of common diseases that frequently coexist in patients with SS.

Sicca symptom in a patient with hemochromatosis: minor salivary gland biopsy for differential diagnosis. This paper reports a case of hemochromatosis with sicca symptom. The patient was a 59-year-old female who had been received a series of intravenous iron injections and blood transfusions because of anemia owing to side-effects of a chemotherapeutic agent. She complained of dry mouth and dry eyes in addition to symptoms of hemochromatosis. The histological appearance of the labial salivary gland, with heavy deposition of iron in acinar and duct epithelial cells and absence of focal lymphoid cell infiltration, did not support a diagnosis of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome but suggested functional damage of the salivary glands related to iron. The patient was given desferrioxamine, and clinical symptoms improved; re-examined labial salivary gland biopsy showed no iron deposition in any parenchymal cells after the treatment.

Bilaterally enlarged parotids and sicca symptoms as a presentation of sarcoidosis: Pivotal role of aspiration cytology in diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by widespread noncaseating granulomas in various organs. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on cytological, clinicolaboratory, and radiological findings, and requires careful exclusion of other granulomatous diseases especially tuberculosis. Involvement of parotid glands is uncommon. Presentation of sarcoidosis with sicca symptoms that include dryness of eyes and mouth is an even rarer phenomenon. We present a case of multisystemic sarcoidosis presenting with dryness of eyes and mouth along with bilateral enlargement of parotid glands. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) smears showed epithelioid cell granulomas and multinucleate giant cells. Stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Careful cytological examination revealed crystalline structures inside the giant cells, which prompted us to evaluate the patient for sarcoidosis. This case report highlights the cytological features that can be useful in clinching the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in conjunction with clinicoradiological and laboratory findings in a clinically unusual case.

[A case of sarcoidosis associated with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome]. A 49-year-old woman, who has had a past history of Raynaud's phenomenon since 1981, dry mouth since 1987 and dry eyes since 1990, was admitted to our hospital complaining of general fatigue, bilateral gonalgia, and shortness of breath in April 1991. Physical examinations revealed bilateral parotid gland enlargement and bilateral uveitis. Her family history included mixed connective tissue disease in her eldest daughter. Laboratory findings indicated an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypergammaglobulinemia, and elevation of serum lysozyme and angiotensin converting enzyme levels. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-SSA antibodies, anti-SSB antibodies were positive, while tuberculin test was negative. Chest X-rays showed bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and small nodular shadows in both lung fields. Increases in lymphocytes and the CD4/CD8 ratio of T cells were noted in alveolar lavage fluid. Renal biopsy revealed non-caseous granulomas. Other remarkable findings included positive Schirmer's test, apple tree lesions by sialography and chronic sialoadenitis by biopsy of the labial minor salivary gland. On the basis of all these findings, we diagnosed her as suffering from sarcoidosis with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome. After oral administration of prednisolone, her shortness of breath, hilar lymphadenopathy and small nodular shadows in the lung field disappeared, but the patient was transferred to the department of urology due to the onset of hydronephrosis. This case is noteworthy because sarcoidosis associated with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome has been reported in only 11 cases in the literature.

Hemoperitoneum From Bleeding Intra-Abdominal Varices: A Rare, Life-Threatening Cause of Abdominal Pain in a Patient With Cirrhosis. We report the case of a 54-year-old male with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented several times to the emergency department (ED) with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Ten days after his initial presentation, the patient represented with hypotension and anemia. An abdominal CT angiogram identified hemorrhage from an ectopic varix successfully treated with emergent glue embolization of mesenteric, omental, and periumbilical varices. Intraperitoneal bleeding from ectopic varices in cirrhosis patients is a rare, life-threatening condition. Consideration and recognition of ectopic variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis can facilitate prompt life-saving treatment in a population susceptible to significant morbidity and mortality.

[Variceal upper digestive bleeding--an ever new complication in liver cirrhosis]. Variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis is a medical emergency with a high mortality. The therapeutic options in patients with portal hypertension are: treatment of acute bleeding from varices, prevention of the first bleeding episode and prevention of rebleeding. Treatment of acute bleeding from varices includes: blood volume restitution, use of antibiotics for preventing bacterial infections, vasoactive drug therapy (terlipressin, somatostatin, vapreotide, octreotide), endoscopic band ligation for acute esophageal bleeding and endoscopic therapy with tissue adhesive (cyanoacrylate) for acute gastric variceal bleeding. Endoscopic treatments are best used in association with pharmacological therapy. In primary prophylaxis non-selective beta- blocker therapy and endoscopic band ligation are useful. Beta blockers, band ligation or both should be used for prevention of recurrent bleeding. In patients who fail endoscopic and pharmacological treatment for prevention of rebleeding TIPS and transplantation should be considered.

Emergency endoscopic ligation of actively bleeding gastric varices with a detachable snare. Bleeding gastric varices (BGV) is a challenging condition whose management remains controversial and often empirical. Over the past 6 months, emergency ligation of BGV was performed in seven cirrhotic patients (five men, two women; age range 47 to 70 years) using a detachable snare. Child's grade was B in two and C in five patients. Two patients had a concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma. Three patients had been previously treated with either balloon tamponade or injection sclerotherapy for bleeding esophageal varices. Hemostasis was achieved in all patients. Morbidity consisted of fever in one case. Six snares passed spontaneously, one was removed from the stomach on follow-up examination. Post-ligation ulcers were detected in all patients after treatment (mean diameter 7.4+/-2.1 mm) with no stigmata of recurrent hemorrhage. No early rebleeding was observed during hospital stay. On a mean follow-up of 3.8 months (range 2 to 6 months), no digestive hemorrhage was recorded. Ligated gastric varices were significantly 'reduced in size in four patients. Emergency ligation with detachable snare is feasible and may be an alternative life-saving method of endoscopic hemostasis in BGV.

Bleeding from gastric body varices effectively treated with endoscopic band ligation. A 55-year-old man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis was admitted to hospital with tarry stools. Videoendoscopy examination on admission revealed blood oozing from the greater curvature of the gastric body (ectopic varices). Endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography were used in making the diagnosis. Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) was performed for the bleeding site of these varices. The patient experienced no further episodes of bleeding during the 6 months following treatment with EBL. EBL was very effective in treating the bleeding from gastric body varices.

[Hemorrhage caused by duodenal varices]. A 53-year-old man had been passing tarry stools and bright red blood per rectum for 6 days. He had a history of pyloroplasty for duodenal ulcers, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, stage B in Child's classification, a Le Veen shunt for ascites, grade I oesophageal varices and several episodes of intestinal bleeding of uncertain cause on repeated endoscopies. Haemoglobin levels was now 4.4 g/dl. Neither oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy nor colposcopy, radiological examination of the small intestine nor scintigraphy discovered the source of bleeding. Computed tomography revealed varices in the horizontal part of the duodenum, confirmed by arteriography. At a second endoscopy, this time with a long scope, acute bleedings were seen in the venous convolutions and stopped with 4 ml Polidocanol. Bleeding recurred after 10 days, thought to be due to persisting portal hypertension. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) was inserted to lower the pressure. Colour-coded Doppler examination at the time of another bleeding 10 weeks later demonstrated occlusion of the TIPSS. It was re-opened by balloon catheter dilatation, since when there have been no further episodes of bleeding. The implantation of a TIPSS is a new causative treatment for recurrent bleeding from ectopic varices due to portal hypertension that cannot be treated by endoscopy.

Diagnostic Evaluation of Patients Presenting to Primary Care with Rectal Bleeding. Rectal bleeding is a common, frequently benign problem that can also be an early sign of colorectal cancer. Diagnostic evaluation for rectal bleeding is complex, and clinical practice may deviate from available guidelines. To assess the degree to which primary care physicians document risk factors for colorectal cancer among patients with rectal bleeding and order colonoscopies when indicated, and the likelihood of physicians ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies based on demographic characteristics, visit patterns, and clinical presentations. Cross-sectional study using explicit chart abstraction methods. Three hundred adults, 40-80Â years of age, presenting with rectal bleeding to 15 academically affiliated primary care practices between 2012 and 2016. 1) The frequency at which colorectal cancer risk factors were documented in patients' charts, 2) the frequency at which physicians ordered colonoscopies and patients received them, and 3) the odds of ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies based on patient demographic characteristics, visit patterns, and clinical presentations. Risk factors for colorectal cancer were documented between 9% and 66% of the time. Most patients (89%) with rectal bleeding needed a colonoscopy according to a clinical guideline. Physicians placed colonoscopy orders for 74% of these patients, and 56% completed the colonoscopy within a year (36% within 60Â days). The odds of physicians ordering recommended colonoscopies were significantly higher in patients aged 50-64Â years of age than in those aged 40-50Â years (ORâ=â2.23, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.80), and for patients whose most recent colonoscopy was 5 or more years ago (ORâ=â4.04, 95% CI: 1.50, 10.83). The odds of physicians ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies were significantly lower for each primary care visit unrelated to rectal bleeding (ORâ=â0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.96). Diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting to primary care with rectal bleeding may be suboptimal because of inadequate risk factor assessment and prioritization of patients' other concurrent medical problems.

Education and management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Are we making progress? A case report. A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic for abdominal pain, diarrhea, intermittent rectal bleeding and weight loss. The family history revealed two deaths due to colorectal cancer (maternal grandmother and patient's mother). The colonoscopy showed hundreds of polyps throughout the colon, and an ulcerative rectosigmoidian tumor. The diagnosis was Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed. Histopathological diagnosis revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out. The patient had three brothers, without clinical symptoms. They had a colonoscopic examination for screening. Two of them were diagnosed with adenomatous polyposis - the first with classic FAP and the other one with the attenuated type (AFAP). The diagnosis of FAP can be made on the basis of either clinical or genetic criteria. When the family history, clinical features, and pathological findings are classic, the diagnosis is straightforward. Screening and prophylactic surgery are effective to prevent colorectal cancer in patients with FAP. Lifelong regular surveillance is necessary to detect and manage extracolonic lesions.

Context:
Risk of colorectal cancer in general practice patients presenting with rectal bleeding, change in bowel habit or anaemia. The aim was to use data routinely collected in general practice to assess the absolute risk of colorectal cancer in patients newly presenting to their general practitioner (GP) with relevant symptoms. Three cohorts were identified from patients attending a sample of UK general practices. Patients with new symptoms of rectal bleeding, changes in bowel habit or anaemia were identified, and their incident rate for colorectal cancer and the positive predictive value (PPV) of each symptom in the following 12 months were calculated by age and gender. The total population over the age of 40 years was 2.8 million, and 9143 incident cases of colorectal cancer were identified. A total of 67,164 patients (28% men) were identified with anaemia, 27,524 (40% men) with changes in bowel habit and 44,741 (48% men) with rectal bleeding. For each cohort, the absolute risk rose with increasing age, and men were twice as likely to develop colorectal cancer. The PPV for developing colorectal cancer in the subsequent 12 months in those aged 60-69 years with anaemia was 3.02% for men, 1.38% for women; with changes in bowel habit 6.89% for men, 2.42% for women; and with rectal bleeding was 5.99% for men, 3.50% for women. A combination of any two signs and symptoms doubled the risk of an underlying cancer. In UK general practice, men are less likely to present with symptoms and signs of colorectal cancer compared with women, but after investigation are much more likely to have a colorectal cancer diagnosed. This should be taken into account in guidelines for referral.

Context:
Early colorectal cancer in a flat adenoma. A 56-year-old man presented with intermittent rectal bleeding of six months' duration. Colonoscopy revealed three left colon polyps, one of which harbored adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic mucosal resection (band-assisted colonoscopic polypectomy) was successful. Endoscopic ultrasonography did not demonstrate any local or regional spread; however, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan raised suspicion of an isolated metastasis to the liver. The patient's mother had recently died from metastatic colorectal cancer. When presented with the options of no surgery, postendoscopic mucosal resection, and CT-directed needle biopsy of the suspected isolated metastasis to the liver versus segmental resection of the flat adenoma site and wedge resection of the liver lesion for the maximum chance of a surgical cure, the patient opted for the surgical approach. Histopathology revealed no evidence of malignancy in the rectosigmoid colon, pericolonic lymph, or liver specimen. Awareness of increased risk of early cancer in flat adenomas with central depression is important because prompt recognition can lead to curative therapy.

Familial adenomatous polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis represents approximately 1% of all colorectal tumours and is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. A 38-year-old lady presented with abdominal pain, diarrhoea and iron deficiency anemia. There was no history of colorectal cancer in the family. Colonoscopy showed hundreds of polyps throughout the colon sparing the rectum, and an ulcerative tumour of the sigmoid colon. The diagnosis was familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed and later on she was given chemotherapy and advice life long surveillance. The patient had one brother and one sister, without clinical symptoms. The brother had a single hyperplastic rectal polyp, while the sister refused colonoscopy. The patient has 2 sons, the elder son had normal colonoscopic findings, and the younger son was also diagnosed as a patient of FAP and referred for colectomy.


Diagnostic Evaluation of Patients Presenting to Primary Care with Rectal Bleeding. Rectal bleeding is a common, frequently benign problem that can also be an early sign of colorectal cancer. Diagnostic evaluation for rectal bleeding is complex, and clinical practice may deviate from available guidelines. To assess the degree to which primary care physicians document risk factors for colorectal cancer among patients with rectal bleeding and order colonoscopies when indicated, and the likelihood of physicians ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies based on demographic characteristics, visit patterns, and clinical presentations. Cross-sectional study using explicit chart abstraction methods. Three hundred adults, 40-80Â years of age, presenting with rectal bleeding to 15 academically affiliated primary care practices between 2012 and 2016. 1) The frequency at which colorectal cancer risk factors were documented in patients' charts, 2) the frequency at which physicians ordered colonoscopies and patients received them, and 3) the odds of ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies based on patient demographic characteristics, visit patterns, and clinical presentations. Risk factors for colorectal cancer were documented between 9% and 66% of the time. Most patients (89%) with rectal bleeding needed a colonoscopy according to a clinical guideline. Physicians placed colonoscopy orders for 74% of these patients, and 56% completed the colonoscopy within a year (36% within 60Â days). The odds of physicians ordering recommended colonoscopies were significantly higher in patients aged 50-64Â years of age than in those aged 40-50Â years (ORâ=â2.23, 95% CI: 1.04, 4.80), and for patients whose most recent colonoscopy was 5 or more years ago (ORâ=â4.04, 95% CI: 1.50, 10.83). The odds of physicians ordering and patients receiving recommended colonoscopies were significantly lower for each primary care visit unrelated to rectal bleeding (ORâ=â0.85, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.96). Diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting to primary care with rectal bleeding may be suboptimal because of inadequate risk factor assessment and prioritization of patients' other concurrent medical problems.

Education and management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Are we making progress? A case report. A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic for abdominal pain, diarrhea, intermittent rectal bleeding and weight loss. The family history revealed two deaths due to colorectal cancer (maternal grandmother and patient's mother). The colonoscopy showed hundreds of polyps throughout the colon, and an ulcerative rectosigmoidian tumor. The diagnosis was Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed. Histopathological diagnosis revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out. The patient had three brothers, without clinical symptoms. They had a colonoscopic examination for screening. Two of them were diagnosed with adenomatous polyposis - the first with classic FAP and the other one with the attenuated type (AFAP). The diagnosis of FAP can be made on the basis of either clinical or genetic criteria. When the family history, clinical features, and pathological findings are classic, the diagnosis is straightforward. Screening and prophylactic surgery are effective to prevent colorectal cancer in patients with FAP. Lifelong regular surveillance is necessary to detect and manage extracolonic lesions.

Emergency radiological examination of the externally stabilized pelvis--there is a catch to it: lessons learned from two cases with symphyseal disruption despite initial inconspicuous computed tomography. Preclinical and early clinical external pelvic stabilization using commercially available devices has become common in trauma patient care. Thus, in the emergency department an increasing number of patients will undergo radiographic evaluation of the externally stabilized pelvis to exclude injuries. While reports exist where injuries to the pelvis were elusive to radiological examination due to the pelvic immobilization we elaborate on an algorithm to remove an external pelvic stabilizing device, prevent delayed diagnosis of pelvic disruption and thus increase patient safety. We report on two patients with external pelvic stabilization presenting with an inconspicuous pubic symphysis on initial pelvic computed tomography scans. The first patient was an otherwise healthy 51-year old male being run over by his own car. He received external pelvic stabilization in the emergency department. The second patient was a 36-year old male falling from a ladder. In this patient external pelvic stabilization was performed at the scene. In the first patient no pelvic injury was obvious on computed tomography. In the second patient pelvic fractures were diagnosed, yet the presentation of the pubic symphysis appeared normal. Nevertheless, complete symphyseal disruption was diagnosed in both of them upon removal of the external pelvic stabilization and consequently required internal fixation. Based on our experience we propose an algorithm to "clear the initially immobilized pelvis" in an effort to minimize the risk of missing a serious pelvic injury and increase patient safety. This is of significant importance to orthopedic trauma surgeons and emergency physicians taking care of injured patients.

Bilateral femoral neck fracture following a convulsion in the presence of chronic kidney disease. A case report. Bilateral femoral neck fractures in young adults are a rare entity. It is usually associated with pre-existing metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, or hypocalcemic seizures. Hence, it is essential in such cases to look for other associated injuries following a traumatic event. Missing associated injuries may lead to significant morbidities and poor functional outcomes. A 37Â years old male, who had chronic renal failure secondary to hypertension, and presented to the emergency room following a seizure episode, in which he developed a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion secondary to electrolyte imbalances with metabolic acidosis. As a result, he developed bilateral neck of femur fracture. The medical team optimized electrolytes imbalance and then the patient underwent surgical stabilization of both femur neck fracture, 1Â year following the surgical fixation the patient had full range of motion of both hips with radiological evidence of complete healing of the fracture. In cases of fractures secondary to metabolic conditions, bilateral femoral neck fractures should be suspected and investigated; especially in young patients who develop a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The etiology is multifactorial, and the treating surgeon should be aware of predisposing factors which may affect bone quality, thereby raising the risk of fractures even with low-energy atraumatic events. Hip preservation should always be the primary target when treating these patients.

Cervical Fracture With Posterior Ligamentous Injury While Skydiving. A 46-year-old male soldier reported to an emergency department with severe acute neck pain immediately following a hyperflexion injury during recreational skydiving. He was evaluated in the emergency department, including radiographs, and released with a diagnosis of "acute neck strain." After presenting with continued neck pain, he was sent for consultation with a physical therapist. The physical therapist ordered cervical spine radiographs, which revealed findings consistent with cervical fracture and ligamentous disruption. In addition, the radiologist recommended computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed bilateral C6 lamina fractures and multiple ligamentous disruption at C5-6.

Bilateral neck femur fracture following a generalized seizure- a rare case report. Hip fractures are one of the most common injuries which present to an orthopaedic surgeon. Most of these cases are unilateral .Bilateral simultaneous femur neck fracture is a rare occurrence. We report a case of a bilateral neck femur fracture in a 30 year male following a generalized tonic clonic seizure in view of its rarity and also to increase the awareness of such rare injuries. The patient was operated within 3 hours. At 5 months, the patient had good radiological and functional outcome. During a convulsion, there is a powerful and forceful contraction of muscles which may lead to fracture or dislocation. The incidence of fractures following a convulsion is 1.1%. A delay in diagnosis can lead to complications like avascular necrosis, osteoarthritis, non union, functional disability and legal consequences. All orthopaedic surgeons and emergency physicians should be aware of such uncommon injuries to ensure early diagnosis and treatment.

Femur fractures should not be considered distracting injuries for cervical spine assessment. The National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) clinical decision rule is extremely sensitive for clearance of cervical spine (C-spine) injury in blunt trauma patients with distracting injuries. We sought to determine whether the NEXUS criteria would maintain sensitivity for blunt trauma patients when femur fractures were not considered a distracting injury and an absolute indication for diagnostic imaging. We retrospectively analyzed blunt trauma patients with at least 1 femur fracture who presented to our emergency department as trauma activations from 2009 to 2011 and underwent C-spine injury evaluation. Presence of C-spine injury requiring surgical intervention was evaluated. Of 566 trauma patients included, 77 (13.6%) were younger than 18 years. Cervical spine injury was diagnosed in 53 (9.4%) of 566. A total of 241 patients (42.6%) had positive NEXUS findings in addition to distracting injury; 51 (21.2%) of these had C-spine injuries. Of 325 patients (57.4%) with femur fractures who were otherwise NEXUS negative, only 2 (0.6%) had C-spine injuries (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2%-2.2%); both were stable and required no operative intervention. Use of NEXUS criteria, excluding femur fracture as an indication for imaging, detected all significant injuries with a sensitivity for any C-spine injury of 96.2% (95% CI, 85.9%-99.3%) and negative predictive value of 99.4% (95% CI, 97.6%-99.9%). In our patient population, all significant C-spine injuries were identified by NEXUS criteria without considering the femur fracture a distracting injury and indication for computed tomographic imaging. Reconsidering femur fracture in this context may decrease radiation exposure and health care expenditure with little risk of missed diagnoses.

It is usually associated with pre-existing metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, or hypocalcemic seizures. Hence, it is essential in such cases to look for other associated injuries following a traumatic event. Missing associated injuries may lead to significant morbidities and poor functional outcomes. A 37Â years old male, who had chronic renal failure secondary to hypertension, and presented to the emergency room following a seizure episode, in which he developed a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion secondary to electrolyte imbalances with metabolic acidosis. As a result, he developed bilateral neck of femur fracture. The medical team optimized electrolytes imbalance and then the patient underwent surgical stabilization of both femur neck fracture, 1Â year following the surgical fixation the patient had full range of motion of both hips with radiological evidence of complete healing of the fracture. In cases of fractures secondary to metabolic conditions, bilateral femoral neck fractures should be suspected and investigated; especially in young patients who develop a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The etiology is multifactorial, and the treating surgeon should be aware of predisposing factors which may affect bone quality, thereby raising the risk of fractures even with low-energy atraumatic events. Hip preservation should always be the primary target when treating these patients.


Cervical Fracture With Posterior Ligamentous Injury While Skydiving. A 46-year-old male soldier reported to an emergency department with severe acute neck pain immediately following a hyperflexion injury during recreational skydiving. He was evaluated in the emergency department, including radiographs, and released with a diagnosis of "acute neck strain." After presenting with continued neck pain, he was sent for consultation with a physical therapist. The physical therapist ordered cervical spine radiographs, which revealed findings consistent with cervical fracture and ligamentous disruption. In addition, the radiologist recommended computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which confirmed bilateral C6 lamina fractures and multiple ligamentous disruption at C5-6.

Opting for Christian Science vs. surgical removal: a case report of a giant basal cell carcinoma arising on the back of a 66-year-old man. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, with giant basal cell carcinoma comprising only 0.5 percent of all basal cell carcinomas. When a basal cell carcinoma is larger than 5 cm, it is designated as a giant basal cell carcinoma. Neglect is often a contributing factor to these lesions, and local recurrence and metastasis is not uncommon. Presented is a case of a 66-year-old man who presented with a chief complaint of increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient was found to have a large 15 cm x 12 cm pedunculated tumor on his back that had been present for 10 years. The patient had forgone medical attention until presenting with a symptomatic anemia due to his belief in Christian Science, which relies on prayer and divine healing for the treatment of illness. Christian Scientists are allowed to see physicians, but they may present with advanced symptoms or disease presentations due to their beliefs. Fortunately, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the tumor was confined to the skin, and biopsy revealed a basal cell carcinoma. Thus, the patient was able to undergo a wide local excision and split thickness skin graft with clear surgical margins.

[Metastatic basal cell carcinoma]. One day before his death, a 66-year-old man who had been suffering since childhood from a severely itching and repeatedly bleeding skin lesion was examined for the first time by a general practitioner who immediately advised hospitalization. On admission, an extensive rodent ulcer on his back was noted and septic shock diagnosed. Because of the hopeless diagnosis no life-supporting measures were undertaken. Postmortem examination revealed an 18 x 26 cm sized ulcerating basal cell carcinoma on the back with infiltration of the thoracic vertebrae and a fist-sized paravertebral abscess between the left upper and lower lobe of the lung and abscessing pneumonia. Two metastases each were found in the right lung and in both kidneys with the histologically characteristic picture of basal cell carcinoma. This case confirms the observation that this type of carcinoma has the potential for metastasizing, but it usually does not do so because of its biological characteristics and early curative excision.

Basal cell carcinomas cause little handicap. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer and the incidence of BCC is expected to rise, with increased demand on dermatology resources. Little is known of the effect on people's lives of having skin cancer. The aim of this study was to quantify the handicap caused gy basal cell carcinomas before and after therapy. Forty-four patients (22 males, mean age = 65 yrs, range = 35-81 yrs) with 48 BCCs were recruited and 37 patients completed the study. Each patient completed the UK Sickness Impact Profile (UKSIP) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at the initial visit to the dermatology clinic, 1 week after treatment and 3 months after treatment. Lesions had been present for a mean of 25 months (range = 1-240 months), their mean diameter was 9.6mm (range = 3-35mm) and the sites were head and neck (79%), trunk (17%) and limbs (4%). There was no relationship between the quality of life score and size of lesion. Overall the scores at presentation were very low, rising 1 week after treatment and falling to below the initial scores at 3 months (mean UKSIP 0.4%, 0.7%, 0.13%; mean DLQI 5.3% 8.7%, 1.2%). BCCs cause little handicap. This may explain the delay in seeking medical attention and should be considered in planning public health education about BCCs.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

Secondary Eating Disorder: A Reality? Case Report of Post Brain Injury Sequelae. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to changes in eating behavior patterns. This report describes the case of a patient with alcohol dependence presenting with behavioral changes and eating disorder following frontal lobe trauma. A 42-year-old male, premorbidly well-adjusted presented with alcohol use in dependent pattern for years. He sustained a subdural hematoma in the frontal lobe following a road traffic accident 10 years back. Post-TBI, the patient, started having low frustration tolerance, aggressive outbursts, disinhibition, difficulty in persisting with tasks, apathy, amotivation, and craving for food with inability to control intake on the sight of food. On testing, a deficit in frontal lobe functions was seen. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed large areas of gliosis and encephalomalacia involving both frontal lobes with parenchymal loss. Eating disorders have been reported after TBI. This case report underscores a major role of frontal-subcortical circuits in regulation of eating habits.

The patient was admitted to our neurological unit on October 4, 1999 because of schizophrenia-like symptom, dysphagia, dysarthria and gait disturbance. She showed slowly progressive rigidity and dystonia. Her parents were the second cousins. Neurological examination revealed bilateral pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, frontal lobe signs (include the imitation behavior). Tendon reflexes were slightly exaggerated in all extremities. Bilateral Babinski, Chaddock and Hoffmann signs were positive. Her verbal IQ on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-revised was 49. Biochemical examination revealed low plasma copper and ceruloplasmin concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Cranial MRI demonstrated diffuse brain atrophy and enlargement of the lateral ventricles. T2-weighted images of the MRI demonstrated hyperintense signal in both thalamus and basal ganglia. SPECT showed hypoperfusion in the left frontal lobe, both thalamus and basal ganglia. EEG revealed diffuse theta wave. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was made and the treatment of D-penicillamine 900 mg per day was started. This hypoperfusion of SPECT and EEG findings improved after 2 months under D-penicillamine therapy. Neurological findings showed slight improvement. A few Wilson's disease patients presenting with mental disorder have been reported. Wilson's disease should always be considered in differential diagnosis of mental disorders. We emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of Wilson's disease.




Question:
A 53-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of strange behavior and emotional outbursts for the past 6 months.

[Rare cases of reflex epilepsy in patients with gliomas of the left hemisphere]. We present the cases of symptomatic reflex epilepsy in patients with left hemisphere tumors. The first case: a 23-year-old man has had tonic-clonic seizures of the tongue with rare secondary localization over the past several months. The seizures were caused by intense tongue movements, in particular rightward and leftward (when having chewing gum or a candy in his mouth), but not during speech production or eating. MRI scanning detected a small tumor in the lower segments of the central gyrus. It was found during the surgery under electrophysiological control that the tumor (Gr II astrocytoma) resided in the zone corresponding to the right half of the tongue and included this zone. The tumor was partially resected. The second patient, a 52-year-old man, has been suffering from generalized seizures since 1998. The seizures were caused by intense verbal load, in the beginning of spontaneous speech and subsequently when the patient was listening to others' speech or was writing. Spontaneous seizures emerged when the patient stopped taking his anti-seizure medications unilaterally. MRI showed glioma in the posterior segments of the left temporal lobe. The patient underwent radiation and chemotherapy. In 2013, the patient's condition worsened (right-sided hemiparesis and severe speech impairment emerged); the tumor was partially resected and an extensive cyst was opened. The third patient, a 38-year-old man with Gr III astrocytoma in the left insula with past medical history of spontaneous vegetative seizures, had only a seizure anticipation caused by strong smells. All the patients were prescribed chemo-, radiation, and anti-seizure therapy.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.


[Acute change in behavior of an elderly patient due to epilepsy]. A man aged 69 years with a history of a cerebrovascular accident showed progressively strange behaviour in two weeks. There were no signs of a neurological disorder. Psychiatric examination revealed psychotic symptoms. The electro encephalogram revealed epileptic activity at the site of the old infarct. The diagnosis was 'psychotic disorder due to a non-convulsive status epilepticus'. Treatment with anti-epileptics was followed by clinical recovery. An epileptic insult must be thought of in every elderly patient with unexplained changed behaviour. A cerebrovascular accident is the main risk factor for developing an insult in elderly.

Secondary Eating Disorder: A Reality? Case Report of Post Brain Injury Sequelae. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to changes in eating behavior patterns. This report describes the case of a patient with alcohol dependence presenting with behavioral changes and eating disorder following frontal lobe trauma. A 42-year-old male, premorbidly well-adjusted presented with alcohol use in dependent pattern for years. He sustained a subdural hematoma in the frontal lobe following a road traffic accident 10 years back. Post-TBI, the patient, started having low frustration tolerance, aggressive outbursts, disinhibition, difficulty in persisting with tasks, apathy, amotivation, and craving for food with inability to control intake on the sight of food. On testing, a deficit in frontal lobe functions was seen. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed large areas of gliosis and encephalomalacia involving both frontal lobes with parenchymal loss. Eating disorders have been reported after TBI. This case report underscores a major role of frontal-subcortical circuits in regulation of eating habits.

Neonatal ileoileocolic intussusception associated with ileal polyp: report of one case. Neonatal intussusception is an uncommon disease. We report a case of neonatal ileoileocolic intussusception led by an ileal polyp in a female neonate. The patient presented with irritable crying, bilious vomiting and frank bloody stool on the 26th day of life. On physical examination, a mobile abdominal mass was palpated. Abdominal sonography demonstrated a long segment intussusception; associated with a low echogenic mass. At laparotomy, ileoileocolic intussusception led by an ileal polyp was found. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of polyp. Because intestinal obstruction is the primary manifestation, neonatal intussusception is initially indistinguishable from obstructions due to other reasons like intestinal atresia, congenital bands, necrotizing enterocolitis or midgut volvulus. Our experience showed that although uncommon, intussusception should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction during the newborn period.

Adult Intestinal Intussusception: Practical Issues and Concerns. A 37-year-old woman with no relevant past medical history presented to the emergency department after a 2-day-long period of crampy abdominal pain with an inability for oral intake because of persistent vomiting. The physical examination was unremarkable. Abdominal CT scan with water-soluble oral contrast revealed an ileocecal intussusception (Fig. 1). Because the patient was hemodynamically stable and no abdominal tenderness was found, a delayed surgical intervention was planned with laparoscopic approach. During intervention, the intestinal invagination was reduced, a cecal neoplasm suspected, and a right hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision was performed (Fig. 2). Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with discharge on postoperative day 5. The definite pathological report showed well-differentiated colon adenocarcinoma pT2N1aMx, with 1 of 49 positive lymph nodes.

Segmental dilatation of the ileum as an unusual cause of gastrointestinal bleeding: report of one case. We report a case of segmental dilatation of the ileum in a 10-month-old male infant. Intermittent loose black-colored stool passage and normocytic anemia were noted at the initial visits to our hospital. There was no symptom or sign of intestinal obstruction such as abdominal distention or vomiting. On physical examination, he was found to be pale but his abdomen was soft and flat. Digital examination revealed brownish stool tinged with black-colored oil-like stool but no polyp. Laboratory studies excluded coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia and lead poisoning. During hospitalization, he was treated with nothing per mouth, intravascular fluids, ranitidine, and transfusion of packed red blood cells. All examinations including panendoscopy, Technetium-99m (99mTc)-pertechnetate Meckel's diverticulum scan, and double contrast colon series revealed no organic lesion except that 99mTc-red blood cell bleeding scans showed abnormal bleeding in the small intestine. Because of his persistent gastrointestinal bleeding with unknown cause, we did an exploratory laparotomy when the patient was 13 months old and idiopathic segmental dilatation of the ileum was confirmed. The dilated segment is supposed to be idiopathic because of histologically proven normal muscle layers without ectopic tissue. This case suggests that segmental dilatation of the ileum can only present as gastrointestinal bleeding without intestinal obstruction.

Rapunzel syndrome in a pediatric patient: a case report. This case report describes a 2.5-year-old girl who was hospitalized with complaints of abdominal pain and vomiting for 2 days. Abdominal ultrasound revealed small bowel-to-small bowel intussusception. Diagnostic laparoscopic-assisted exploration of the abdomen revealed 4 separate intestinal intussusceptions along with multiple dark intraluminal masses within the small intestine. Laparoscopic reduction of the intussusceptions was unsuccessful. Laparotomy allowed palpation of the entire small intestine with extraction of the masses, which were found to be human hair (trichobezoars). The intussusceptions were reduced, and the multiple masses were removed through a single enterotomy. The child recovered following surgery and was discharged home to her family. The surgeon counseled the parents before discharging the patient and recommended follow-up counseling for their child. The parents were given information about trichophagia and strategies to reduce the behavior in their child. A comprehensive literature review revealed this to be the youngest reported case of intussusception and Rapunzel syndrome due to trichobezoars.

Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of polyp. Because intestinal obstruction is the primary manifestation, neonatal intussusception is initially indistinguishable from obstructions due to other reasons like intestinal atresia, congenital bands, necrotizing enterocolitis or midgut volvulus. Our experience showed that although uncommon, intussusception should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction during the newborn period.


Adult Intestinal Intussusception: Practical Issues and Concerns. A 37-year-old woman with no relevant past medical history presented to the emergency department after a 2-day-long period of crampy abdominal pain with an inability for oral intake because of persistent vomiting. The physical examination was unremarkable. Abdominal CT scan with water-soluble oral contrast revealed an ileocecal intussusception (Fig. 1). Because the patient was hemodynamically stable and no abdominal tenderness was found, a delayed surgical intervention was planned with laparoscopic approach. During intervention, the intestinal invagination was reduced, a cecal neoplasm suspected, and a right hemicolectomy with complete mesocolic excision was performed (Fig. 2). Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with discharge on postoperative day 5. The definite pathological report showed well-differentiated colon adenocarcinoma pT2N1aMx, with 1 of 49 positive lymph nodes.




Question:
A 10-month-old infant is brought in by his parents because he is vomiting and not passing stool. His parents say he has vomited multiple times over the past couple of hours, but the most recent vomit was green. The patient has no significant past medical history. On physical examination, the patient is irritable and crying. On palpation in the periumbilical region, an abdominal mass is present. Emergency laparotomy is performed, which shows a part of the patient’s intestine folded into the section adjacent to it. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?

[A] : Meckel’s diverticulum
[B] : Duodenal atresia
[C] : Pyloric stenosis
[D] : Intussusception

A prospective study of risk factors for symptomatic urinary tract infection in young women. Although acute urinary tract infections are common in young women, the associated risk factors have not been defined prospectively. We recruited sexually active young women who were starting a new method of contraception at a university health center or a health maintenance organization (HMO) and monitored them for six months for symptomatic urinary tract infections. Daily diaries and serial interviews were used to collect data on potential risk factors. Among 796 women, the incidence of urinary tract infections per person-year was 0.7 in the university cohort (mean age, 23 years; n = 348) and 0.5 in the HMO cohort (mean age, 29; n = 448). In both cohorts, there were strong dose-response relations between the risk of infection and both recent use of a diaphragm with spermicide (respective relative risks for one, three, and five days of use in the past week, 1.42, 2.83, and 5.68 in the university cohort, P&lt;0.001; and 1.29, 2.14, and 3.54 in the HMO cohort, P=0.04) and recent sexual intercourse (respective relative risks for one, three, and five days with intercourse in the past week, 1.37, 2.56, and 4.81 in the university cohort, P&lt;0.001; and 1.24, 1.91, and 2.96 in the HMO cohort, P=0.002). The risk of acute infection was also associated with a history of recurrent infection (relative risk, 5.58 in the university group and 2.10 in the HMO group) but not with cervical-cap use, ABO-blood-group nonsecretor phenotype, or delayed postcoital voiding. Among sexually active young women the incidence of symptomatic urinary tract infection is high, and the risk is strongly and independently associated with recent sexual intercourse, recent use of a diaphragm with spermicide, and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.

Recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in women: allowing patients to self-initiate antibiotic therapy. Acute uncomplicated cystitis is a lower urinary tract infection occurring in the absence of anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract or any other complicating factors.The organism responsible is often an enterobacterium, especially Escherichia coli. What is the role of antibiotic therapy for non-pregnant women with recurrent acute uncomplicated cystitis? We reviewed the available evidence using the standard Prescrire methodology. A single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol is the antibiotic of choice for treating an episode of acute uncomplicated cystitis. Alternative antibiotics are certain fluoroquinolones or co-trimoxazole (a fixed-dose combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim). For recurrent acute uncomplicated cystitis, cranberry juice has modest efficacy in reducing the frequency of episodes. A number of non-drug measures are typically proposed, although their effects are unproven: drinking sufficient fluids and urinating regularly; urinating after sexual intercourse; and avoiding spermicides. The strategy that results in the lowest antibiotic exposure is a short course of antibiotics for each episode of urinary tract infection, initiated as soon as clinical symptoms appear. Long-term antibiotic therapy is sometimes offered. According to one systematic review, women taking long-term prophylactic antibiotic therapy had about 6 times fewer clinical recurrences than with placebo. According to one randomised trial, 3 g of fosfomycin trometamol taken as a single dose every ten days reduced the frequency of recurrence, resulting in 0.14 episodes of infection per year on average versus about 3 episodes with placebo (p &lt; 0.001). The amount of antibiotic used when fosfomycin trometamol is taken every 10 days for 6 months is equivalent to treatment of 18 acute episodes of cystitis. When cystitis appears to be associated with sexual intercourse, two small randomised trials suggest that routine postcoital antibiotic treatment is more effective than placebo and as effective as long-term antibiotic therapy. Adverse effects, some of which can be serious, depend on the antibiotic used. The development of resistance among enterobacteria is one argument for limiting the use of antibiotics, in order to preserve their efficacy in serious infections. In practice, the strategy that uses the fewest antibiotics is to treat each episode as soon as the first clinical symptoms appear. Cases in which the frequency of recurrence warrants regular antibiotic prophylaxis are rare. The optimal antibiotic regimen in these cases has not been determined, either in clinical trials or by consensus.

Sexual activity, contraceptive use, and other risk factors for symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria. A case-control study. In a study to determine the risk factors for urinary tract infection in college-aged women, women who presented with acute urinary tract infection to the student health service were compared to women without bacteriuria who presented with complaints of other acute illnesses. Among women who were sexually active, the following multivariate adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were found; intercourse in the previous 48 hours, 58.1 (11.9 to 284.1); intercourse only in the previous 3 to 7 days, 9.1 (1.9 to 44.1); diaphragm use in the previous 48 hours, 8.4 (3.4 to 21.1); urination after intercourse, 0.5 (0.3 to 0.9); and past history of urinary tract infection, 2.7 (1.5 to 5.0). Several other factors previously postulated to be related to urinary tract infection were found not to be associated, including oral contraceptive use, tampon use, and direction of wiping after a bowel movement. When the women with symptomatic bacteriuria were compared to women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, the results were similar, except diaphragm use and urination after intercourse were no longer associated with urinary tract infection. When the women with asymptomatic bacteriuria were compared to women without symptoms and without bacteriuria, diaphragm use remained the only statistically significant risk factor. These findings should be taken into account in attempts to prevent urinary tract infection, as well as in subsequent studies of this disease.

Relationship between frequency of sexual intercourse and urinary tract infections in young women. We compared personal and sexual behavior of a group of 32 young adult women who had a culture proven urinary tract infection (UTI) and a group of 28 women who had no urinary symptoms. All women were sexually active, and the two groups were similar for age, race, marital status, history of previous pregnancy, and use of oral contraceptives. The major finding was an increase in the frequency of sexual intercourse by the study group immediately before the onset of symptoms. No group differences were found for manner of perineal hygiene, frequency of urination, frequency of refraining from voiding after the initial urge, and frequency of urinating after coitus. We conclude that an increase in sexual intercourse may be one of the factors involved in the development of a symptomatic UTI in young women.

Acute Bilateral Compartment Syndrome of the Forearms. A 43-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with severe bilateral forearm pain. On examination, both forearms were tense and swollen and the patient had excruciating pain, made much worse on passive extension of the fingers. The pain did not resolve with analgesia. The symptoms and clinical examination were highly suspicious for compartment syndrome. However, there was no history of trauma, strenuous physical activity, or any other obvious factor that might have precipitated the onset of a compartment syndrome. The serum creatinine kinase at presentation was greater than 37,000. The patient, however, did have a history of hypertension and was taking losartan, an angiotensinogen II antagonist that has been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The patient was brought to surgery for emergency fasciotomies and made an excellent recovery after surgery. The etiology of this patient's bilateral compartment syndrome is uncertain but may be a manifestation of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Not Just Another "Found Down": Concomitant Upper Arm and Gluteal Compartment Syndrome. Compartment syndrome is often considered in patients with long-bone fractures and soft-tissue injuries, but is not as commonly associated with a period of unconsciousness. A 65-year-old man was brought to our emergency department (ED) because he had lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time after snorting heroin. He had severe pain in his upper right arm. Physical examination revealed right arm edema, paresthesia, tenderness, and firmness to palpation. During the ED assessment, the patient began to experience pain in his right hip to a degree exceeding examination findings. We considered compartment syndrome affecting his upper arm as well as his gluteal muscles. The patient was taken to the operating room for fasciotomy. The triceps muscle was found to be bulging out of the compartment, demonstrating advanced compartment syndrome. A posterior approach to the hip allowed the gluteal sling and the fascia to be released, eliminating tension on the gluteus medius/minimus and gluteus maximus compartments. With physical therapy, the patient regained full flexion and extension in his arm at the elbow, partial extension of his wrist, and range of motion and strength in his hip. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: If not recognized, compartment syndrome can jeopardize limb and life. It should be considered in patients experiencing inordinate pain, especially if they were found unconscious at the incident scene. Pressure-induced ischemia can impair muscle function within hours. If it is not relieved with fasciotomy, the patient can sustain irreversible functional loss.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke. A 49 year-old man with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement in the right coronary artery in 2010 presented for evaluation of left hemiplegia. He was feeling well until three hours prior to presentation, at which time he fell while walking from his bedroom into the kitchen. After falling, he noticed that his left upper and lower extremities felt weak. He denied any symptoms preceding the fall or any loss of consciousness. On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

Radius regeneration after open fracture and extrusion: a case report. A pediatric patient presenting with an open forearm fracture with segmental defect is rare, and the pediatric orthopedic literature to guide treatment is sparse. There are several described methods to treat the defect, including bone grafting and bone transport techniques. In addition, there are reports of fibular regeneration after resection if the periosteum is left intact. We present a case report of complete regeneration of over half of a pediatric radial shaft with an intact periosteum, after traumatic extrusion from an open fracture. A 6-year-old girl presented with a Gustilo Grade-IIIB open fracture with extrusion and loss of 7âcm of her radial shaft. Initially, the arm was stabilized using a monoplanar external fixator. She developed a compartment syndrome and underwent volar forearm fasciotomies. We found her periosteum grossly intact and decided to allow its natural biology to provide healing potential for the radial defect. She was placed into a circular external fixator, leaving her wrist and elbow free, and her ulna was stabilized with a flexible intramedullary nail. Soft tissue coverage was obtained with a split thickness skin graft. The patient's skin graft healed uneventfully and there were radiographic signs of bone regeneration by 2 weeks postoperatively. She maintained most of her elbow and wrist motion while in her external fixator. She developed a small pin site infection that resolved with oral antibiotics. By 10 weeks postoperatively, radiographs showed adequate corticalization and the fixator was removed. By 8 months postoperatively, the patient was released to full activity with nearly full function and range of motion. Our patient sustained a severe and rare injury but had an excellent outcome with minimal complications. This report represents a method of treatment for large bony defects in children if the periosteum is grossly intact, as opposed to more complex procedures. The intact periosteum can regenerate bony defects in the forearm if stabilized appropriately. Level 4; case report.

PFO closure in high-risk patient with paradoxical arterial embolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and factor V Leiden genetic mutation. Occurrence of paradoxical arterial embolism may cause the first symptoms in patients with a coexisting hypercoagulable state and patent foramen ovale (PFO). This can result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the location of the embolism. The risks and benefits of closure of small PFOs have not been well elucidated in prior studies. We describe a patient with a history of Factor V Leiden heterozygosity who presented with left arm pain secondary to arterial embolism. The patient was a 51-year-old male who initially presented to the emergency department after awaking from sleep with progressive, severe, burning left arm pain. He had also noted intermittent shortness of breath over the 2 weeks prior to admission. Temperature was 97.4 F, pulse 86, respiratory rate 20 and blood pressure 121/87. Oxygen saturation was 94% on supplemental oxygen. He had a cool left upper extremity and the patient described subjective paresthesias in this extremity. Left radial pulse was difficult to palpate. Physical exam was otherwise unremarkable. Troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.217 ng/l. White blood cell count was 11.8 and INR 1.1. EKG showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific T abnormalities in the anterior leads. His past medical history was notable for only hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current recommendation is for antiplatelet or anticoagulation for those with hypercoaguable states who suffer a stroke; there is currently no absolute indication for closure device. We describe the case of a 51-year-old male who had presented with left arm pain and shortness of breath. The computed tomography (CT) angiography of chest showed pulmonary emboli with heavy clot burden bilaterally. Heparin was started, but patient was found to have occlusion along large arteries of the left arm. Emergent left axillary, brachial, radial and ulnar embolectomy for acute critical arm ischemia were performed. The transthoracic echocardiogram done the next day with bubble study was positive for patent foramen ovale. Hypercoaguability showed factor V Leiden heterozygosity. Decision was made for the patient to initiate long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban and closure was performed. Patient was advised that closure is off label but opted to proceed with closure in light of hypercoaguable state.

Pressure Urticaria in an Infant Appearing Similar to Physical Abuse. A healthy Hispanic boy was born via cesarean delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy. At 4 weeks oldâ, his parents brought him to the emergency department for bruising on both soles of the feet. At 6 weeks old, his parents brought him to primary care for new bruises on his arms and back. After evaluation, primary care referred the patient to the emergency department. The parents denied any recent trauma, fever, cough, decreased urine, or change in appetite. Because of 2 episodes of unexplained bruising, the Department of Children and Families was granted emergency custody of the child. Hematology and ophthalmology did not identify any clear abnormalities. Skeletal surveys were normal. Dermatology was consulted. The examination was normal except for pink blanching patches on the upper back and linearly arranged pink blanching papules on the right lower leg. No crusting, erosions, hyperpigmentation, purpura, petechiae, or ecchymoses were seen. These lesions completely resolved the next day. He tested positive for dermatographism and developed similar lesions on his soles after pushing his feet down onto a soft surface. The intermittent urticarial skin changes were most consistent with physical urticaria. Such lesions could be mistaken for trauma; however, blood vessel damage typically results in progressive coloration changes for &gt;1 day. At the emergency court hearing, given the concurring medical opinions of the dermatologist, pediatrician, and Child Protective Services, the judge returned full custody to the parents. This case reveals the value of dermatologic expertise in assessing skin changes, particularly those associated with physical abuse.

Pediatric sun exposure. The risk of malignant melanoma may double if severe sunburns are experienced during childhood. Because children are exposed to sunlight for the longest period of time before age 21, regular use of sunscreen can reduce a child's lifetime risk of developing skin cancer. Therefore, preventive education is vital for parents of infants, preschool and school-age children, and adolescents. By assessing a child's risk factors, health care providers, teachers, and child-care professionals can incorporate preventive sun-safety education into their practice. This effort needs to occur at the community, state, and national level for widespread preventive sun safety and protection. In collaboration with the Healthy People 2000 project and in compliance with the United States Preventive Service recommendations, health care providers can help reduce the incidence of skin cancers in the American population.

Delayed photosensitivity in a child with erythropoietic protoporphyria : a case report. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a genetically inherited disease that causes protoporphyrin accumulation in erythrocytes, skin, liver, bile, and stool. Clinically this manifests as photosensitivity with painful, edematous cutaneous porphyria. We present the case of a four-year-old boy with a delayed photosensitivity reaction to sunlight. In the evening following sun exposure, he would develop swelling and a violaceous rash on the dorsal surface of his hands and occasionally the helix of his ears. His reactions were severe, requiring morphine on more than one occasion prior to diagnosis. He later developed waxy depressed scars on his nose and cheeks. On laboratory investigation, both total and free protoporphyrin were elevated. Photosensitivity in EPP usually occurs minutes after sun exposure, but our patient had significantly delayed reactions. Genetic testing revealed mutation in the FECH gene that confirmed the diagnosis of EPP. Although rare, presentations of photosensitivity in the pediatric population should be carefully evaluated.

Too hot to trot (barefoot)â¦ A study of burns in children caused by sun heated surfaces in Queensland, Australia. The aim of this study was to quantify and describe the characteristics of burns in children caused by sun heated surfaces. Children presenting between January 2013 and February 2014 with a burn due to sun heated surfaces were included in the study. Fifteen children were identified representing 1.7% of new burns. The mean age was 18.3 months. All burns occurred during the warmer months between 11a.m. and 4p.m. and the feet were commonly involved. Most cases occurred in the child's home garden but six cases occurred in public play areas. Metal was the most common surface involved. Most burns were superficial partial thickness with two burns deep dermal partial thickness and one child needed a skin graft. Burns due to sun heated surfaces are relatively frequent. Parents need to be aware that in summer surfaces can become hot enough to cause burns to bare feet in young children. Play areas need to be shaded or covered in surfaces that do not become hot enough to cause burns and metal objects should not be left in the sun in children's play areas.

Pain, swelling and irritability in the sun: what is the diagnosis? A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2âyears.A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'.Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 37-year-old woman presented with increasing abdominal pain and jaundice. Six weeks before admission, she developed persistent diarrhea and jaundice of the skin. She also bruised easily, and her gums bled. In the subsequent weeks, her appetite decreased, she was fatigued, and she had nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. She had a history of drinking 1 quart of vodka every day for 20 years, with brief periods of abstinence; she stopped consuming alcohol 11 days before admission because it no longer provided symptomatic relief. Her past medical history was also notable for depression, including a suicide attempt 4 years earlier. She did not smoke, use illicit drugs, or have unprotected sexual intercourse. She had received no blood transfusions and had not traveled recently. She took no medications, except for occasional ibuprofen. On physical examination, she was thin and deeply jaundiced, and she trembled and responded slowly to questions. She was afebrile but tachypneic, and she had orthostatic hypotension.

Mystery in the basement. 56 year-old male presented to the University of Mississippi Medical Center emergency department (ED) with complaints of progressive shortness of breath, productive cough, fever, and malaise. His past medical history was significant for hypertension as well as a 60 pack-year history of smoking. Upon arrival to the ED he had a temperature of 103.6 degrees F, blood pressure of 80/40 mm Hg, a pulse of 110 beats per minute, respirations of 28 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 50% on room air. He appeared to be in significant respiratory distress. Lung examination revealed diffuse bilateral rhonchi and wheezes in all lung fields. He was emergently intubated. Chest radiograph demonstrated a miliary pattern scattered throughout all lung fields in addition to parenchymal opacities. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 33,500 10(3)/microL, hematocrit of 37%, and platelets of 906,000 10(3)/uL. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 27 mg/dL and 1.0 mg/dL, respectively. Initial ABG on 100% oxygen showed pH 7.15, pCO2 82 mm Hg, and pO2 62 mm Hg. Troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were obtained.

What the mind knows but the eyes may still miss: reducing the 'Acromegalic Window'. A 46-year-old Asian man was referred to our endocrine unit (April 2013) by his general practitioner for investigation of a neck mass. Ultrasound scan of the neck and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels revealed a euthyroid multinodular goitre. He presented with symptoms of frequent headaches, polydypsia, polyuria, perspiration and night sweats and demonstrated classic physical features of acromegaly. In retrospect, the patient's medical history included encounters with numerous physicians from an array of specialties for over 20âyears, mostly for symptoms well recognised to be attributed to growth hormone (GH) excess. Random insulin-like growth factor-1 level was elevated at 103ânmol/L (normal 13-37ânmol/L) and oral glucose tolerance test showed non-suppressible GH secretion (15.06âmIU/L at 120âmin). MRI revealed a mildly enlarged pituitary gland. The patient has been referred for surgery. This case highlights that, even with classic features of acromegaly, there may be a wide-ranging 'Acromegalic Window' between first presentation and clinical suspicion to eventual diagnosis.

Acromegaly diagnosed in a young woman presenting with headache and arthritis. A 38-year-old woman presented with severe headaches to her primary-care physician. The patient had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and had begun having headache 4 years previously. An MRI scan revealed an 11-12 mm pituitary tumor. Her physical examination was unremarkable for the classic acral or facial changes characteristic of acromegaly, and she was referred for neuroendocrine consultation for a presumed nonfunctioning adenoma. MRI of the pituitary, and laboratory investigations that included measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and prolactin levels. In view of the elevated level of IGF1 and presence of a pituitary adenoma, the patient was diagnosed with acromegaly caused by a pituitary adenoma that secretes growth hormone. The patient underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery, which resulted in resolution of joint pain and headache, eradication of the tumor mass, normal IGF1 levels, and appropriate suppression of growth hormone (confirmed by oral glucose tolerance test postoperatively).

Context:
Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy and multiple organ failure in pheochromocytoma. A 55-year-old Caucasian woman with no significant past medical history presented with chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and nausea. Physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 182/87Â mmHg, heart rate (HR) of 74 beats per minute (bpm), temperature of 98.3ÂºF, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 15 liters (L) of oxygen per minute. Her initial labs revealed troponin of 0.26Â ng/mL (&lt;0.01Â ng/mL), blood glucose of 497 mg/dL (70-99 mg/dL), lactic acid of 6.9Â mmol/L (0.4-1.9Â mmol/L), and white blood cell (WBC) of 21.6Â K/uL (4-11.0Â K/uL). EKG showed ST elevation in leads V1 and V2. CT Pulmonary angiography with contrast ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism revealed a right adrenal mass measuring 3.5 cm x 4.1 cm. Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for ST elevation myocardial infarction, hyperglycemia, and sepsis. She was started on heparin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and insulin. Emergent echocardiogram revealed 40-45% ejection fraction with septal, lateral, anteroseptal, and posterolateral hypokinesis. Troponin elevation to 1.00Â ng/mL (&lt;0.01Â ng/mL) warranted a cardiac angiography which revealed new-onset systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with normal coronary vessels. A relatively rapid improvement in her clinical course suggested that a functioning tumor could be the underlying etiology. Diagnostic work-up for pheochromocytoma showed elevated metanephrine and normetanephrine. Subsequent surgical biopsy of the adrenal mass was consistent with pheochromocytoma. It was a rare case presentation of pheochromocytoma with catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy and multiple organ failure.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. Antiglomerular basement membrane disease. A 47-year-old Taiwanese man with no notable medical history was admitted with low-grade fevers and night sweats that had persisted for 5 to 6 weeks. An extensive investigation at another hospital could not determine the cause of the fevers, but documented acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen level of 60 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL. He was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation.The patient, who had been living in the United States for the past 20 years, reported no recent travel and no behaviors that are associated with transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. He was not taking any medications, and he denied using herbal or nutritional supplements. He had no recent weight loss. There were no specific complaints on review of systems. On physical examination, he was a thin, middle-aged man in no distress. Vital signs included a temperature of 37.5 degrees C, a blood pressure of 166/86 mm Hg, a pulse of 70 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. Sclera were anicteric, and he had no palpable adenopathy. His lungs were clear, and his heart rate was regular without extra sounds. His abdomen was thin, nontender, and without masses or organomegaly. There was no edema or signs of embolism in the extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 14,200/mL(3), a hematocrit of 23.1%, and a platelet count of 456,000/mL(3). Blood chemistries were notable for a blood urea nitrogen level of 61 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 7.6 mg/dL. Levels of aminotransferases, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. Urinalysis revealed large hemoglobin, 1+ protein, numerous red blood cells, and 3 to 5 white blood cells. Numerous red blood cell casts were seen on microscopic examination of the urine sediment. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate was &gt;130 mm/h, and his C-reactive protein level was elevated at 12.6 mg/dL. Serologies were negative for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; serum complement levels were normal. What is the diagnosis?

Periorbital ecchymoses and breathlessness. A 54-year-old man presented at our facility with a 3-month history of exertional breathlessness and purple blotches around his eyes. Examination revealed bilateral periorbital and perioral ecchymosis, purpuric spots along his waist, and waxy papules on his eyelids. In addition, the patient had macroglossia with nodular infiltration and irregular indentations at the lateral margin of his tongue. The patient also had a raised jugular venous pressure and prominent atrial and ventricular waves. Further examination revealed a fourth heart sound over the left ventricular apex, as well as bilateral basal rales. All other systems were normal except for mild hepatomegaly. Routine hematologic and biochemical lab work was unremarkable. X-rays of the spine and skull were normal, but a chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly. An electrocardiogram showed a QS complex from leads V1 to V4 (a pseudo-infarction pattern). An echocardiogram showed biatrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 48%, a speckled pattern on the myocardium, a thickened interatrial septum, and mild pericardial effusion. A color Doppler revealed mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with a restrictive pattern of mitral valve flow. Serum protein electrophoresis was normal. WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS?

What the mind knows but the eyes may still miss: reducing the 'Acromegalic Window'. A 46-year-old Asian man was referred to our endocrine unit (April 2013) by his general practitioner for investigation of a neck mass. Ultrasound scan of the neck and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels revealed a euthyroid multinodular goitre. He presented with symptoms of frequent headaches, polydypsia, polyuria, perspiration and night sweats and demonstrated classic physical features of acromegaly. In retrospect, the patient's medical history included encounters with numerous physicians from an array of specialties for over 20âyears, mostly for symptoms well recognised to be attributed to growth hormone (GH) excess. Random insulin-like growth factor-1 level was elevated at 103ânmol/L (normal 13-37ânmol/L) and oral glucose tolerance test showed non-suppressible GH secretion (15.06âmIU/L at 120âmin). MRI revealed a mildly enlarged pituitary gland. The patient has been referred for surgery. This case highlights that, even with classic features of acromegaly, there may be a wide-ranging 'Acromegalic Window' between first presentation and clinical suspicion to eventual diagnosis.


Acromegaly diagnosed in a young woman presenting with headache and arthritis. A 38-year-old woman presented with severe headaches to her primary-care physician. The patient had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and had begun having headache 4 years previously. An MRI scan revealed an 11-12 mm pituitary tumor. Her physical examination was unremarkable for the classic acral or facial changes characteristic of acromegaly, and she was referred for neuroendocrine consultation for a presumed nonfunctioning adenoma. MRI of the pituitary, and laboratory investigations that included measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and prolactin levels. In view of the elevated level of IGF1 and presence of a pituitary adenoma, the patient was diagnosed with acromegaly caused by a pituitary adenoma that secretes growth hormone. The patient underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery, which resulted in resolution of joint pain and headache, eradication of the tumor mass, normal IGF1 levels, and appropriate suppression of growth hormone (confirmed by oral glucose tolerance test postoperatively).

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. PRESENTING FEATURES: A 70-year-old African American man was admitted with a history of fever, chills, and malaise of several days' duration. His past medical history was notable for end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, coronary artery disease, and aortic stenosis requiring a bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. On the day of admission, the patient was noted to have a shaking chill while undergoing dialysis through his catheter and was admitted to the hospital. He complained of pain at the catheter insertion site, shortness of breath, and dyspnea on exertion, but denied chest pain. On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 100.4 degrees F, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/72 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. He was a mildly obese man in no apparent distress. He had shotty cervical lymphadenopathy and a right subclavian dialysis catheter in place, with erythema and pus at the entry site. His jugular venous pressure was 10 cm H(2)O. Lung examination showed bibasilar rales. Heart sounds were normal, with no rub or gallop. He had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heart at the left sternal border as well as a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to his left axilla. Examination of the abdomen and extremities was unremarkable. The patient's neurological examination was unremarkable, and he was alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Laboratory studies showed an elevated white blood cell count of 16,700 cells/microL. His blood urea nitrogen level was 43 mg/dL and his serum creatinine level was 4.9 mg/dL. Multiple blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. An admission, chest radiograph showed no infiltrate.

Silent broken heart (Can shortness of breath be the only presentation of myocardial infarction?). A 55-year-old previously healthy man was referred to our cardiology outpatient department (by the respiratory team) due to shortness of breath that started 2-3 months prior. He suddenly became breathless after changing a car wheel with no other associated symptoms. Specifically, he denied ever having had chest pain. His breathlessness got gradually worse preventing him from performing simple everyday activities, such as climbing stairs, and a couple of weeks before presentation, the patient noticed ankle oedema. He was an ex-smoker and drank 3-4 units of alcohol daily. There was a family history of hypertension. He worked as a contract manager in the construction industry. After clinical examination, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and the patient was admitted for further investigations. Clinical examination and investigation confirmed missed myocardial infarction with a complication of ventricular aneurysm. The patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgeons for surgical correction of the defect.

An unusual cause of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented to clinic with a 2-month history of worsening shortness of breath on exertion and a single episode of chest pain 1 week before. Her ECG in clinic showed ST elevation inferiorly and she was admitted from clinic for further investigations as inpatient. She was initiated on the acute coronary syndrome protocol and underwent emergency left heart catheterisation on the day of admission. The coronary angiogram revealed large aneurysmal dilations in the right coronary artery and left main stem. A ventriculogram showed poor left ventricular (LV) systolic function in line with subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed her to have an left ventricular ejection-fraction (LVEF) of approximately 20%. It was agreed with the cardiothoracic surgeons to treat the aneurysms non-operatively and start low-molecular weight heparin. Furthermore the underlying biventricular impairment was treated with ACE-inhibitors, Î²-blockers and diuretic therapy (loop and potassium-sparing). The strategy was to prevent further thrombus formation with the aneurysmal vessels and to achieve this the patient was initiated on lifelong warfarin. Other medical risk factors were optimised and patient started on statin medication. The aneurysm was monitored with serial CTs with a view to reconsider surgical intervention if any evidence of dilation. This case highlights an unusual cause of ST elevation myocardial infarction.




Question:
A 78-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. He also complains of difficulty breathing while lying down. He also is concerned because he startles from sleep and feels like he is choking. These symptoms have been bothering him for the last several weeks and they are getting worse.

A 61-Year-Old Man With Shortness of Breath, Ascites, and Lower Extremity Edema. A 61-year-old man presented with an 18-month history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, worsening bilateral lower extremity edema, abdominal swelling, and increased assistance with activities of daily living. Pertinent past medical history included right-sided pneumonia secondary to Streptococcus pneumoniae that was complicated by empyema, requiring right-sided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication 2 years earlier. He had a negative cardiac history, no recent travel in the last 3 years, and no known exposure to tuberculosis. His medications included aspirin and daily furosemide. His symptoms appeared to be refractory to diuretic therapy. Previous workup 6Â months earlier included an echocardiography (ECHO) showing enlarged left and right atria with a normal ejection fraction, and a catheterization of the left side of the heart with reported normal left ventricular function and unobstructed coronary arteries.


An 82-Year-Old Man With Sleep-Onset Insomnia, Breathing Arrest, and Heart Failure. An 82-year-old man presented with 6Â months of difficulties of falling asleep. He described a feeling of fading breath culminating in breathing arrest when he becomes drowsy. These recurrent events prevented him from falling asleep. Symptoms would only appear when he went to sleep but not during wakefulness. Medical history comprised several episodes of acute decompensated heart failure due to supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with need for hospitalization during the last 2 years. He additionally had two-vessel coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, and chronic kidney disease (stage 3). Medication included diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, beta-blocker, statin, clopidogrel, and phenprocoumon without sedatives or analgesics.

Question:
A 72-year-old man is brought in by his daughter who is concerned about his recent memory impairment. The patient’s daughter says she has noticed impairment in memory and functioning for the past month. She says that he has forgotten to pay bills and go shopping, and, as a result, the electricity was cut off due to non-payment. She also says that last week, he turned the stove on and forgot about it, resulting in a kitchen fire. The patient has lived by himself since his wife died last year. He fondly recalls living with his wife and how much he misses her. He admits that he feels ‘down’ most days of the week living on his own and doesn’t have much energy. When asked about the kitchen fire and problems with the electricity, he gets defensive and angry. At the patient’s last routine check-up 3 months ago, he was healthy with no medical problems. His vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient appears to have a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Differential diagnosis of memory impairment in areas affected by a natural disaster:a case report. We treated a man with a chief complaint of memory impairment after the Great East Japan Earthquake. Initially, he was diagnosed with dementia. However, after several tests, neither could a definitive diagnosis of dementia be reached, nor was there any apparent evidence for depression, epilepsy, delirium, or internal medicine diseases. During the earthquake, the patient experienced the severe trauma of watching his wife being swept away by a tsunami. Furthermore, he experienced separation from his family. Because of this traumatic experience, we suspected that dissociative disorder was involved in the development of the memory impairment and thus, we switched to treatments focusing on emotional support. Subsequently, the patient's memory impairment gradually improved. The present case demonstrates the importance of considering dissociative disorders when examining a patient with memory impairment in areas affected by disasters.

The fuzzy frontier between subjective memory complaints and early dementia. A survey of patient management in German memory clinics. Mild cognitive decline is frequent in the elderly population. Whether it is related to normal aging or an early phase of evolving dementia is difficult to ascertain with confidence, and accordingly there is a lack of consensus guidelines for diagnosis and therapy in such patients. We assessed the variability with which memory clinics deal with this problem in everyday practice. We sent three fictitious case histories to all 85 German memory clinics that contained the results of clinical examination and neuropsychological test scores and asked for diagnosis and patient management. Patient 1 presented with complaints of mental decline but normal neuropsychological and neurological evaluation and normal daily living activities. Patient 2 came in as a control subject for a study and had impaired test scores but preserved daily living activities, and patient 3 was brought in by relatives with slight impairment of daily living activities and decline in some neuropsychological test scores but relatively spared memory scores. Most of the 51 respondents agreed in recommending further neuropsychological testing, a basic laboratory work-up, brain imaging, and a re-examination after 3-6 months. Yet, there was a high variability in the diagnostic terms used, in the additional diagnostic procedures proposed, and in the recommendations concerning therapeutic intervention and driving. The results reveal a need of practice guidelines for the use of diagnostic terms, therapeutic interventions and driving recommendations in patients between subjective memory complaints and early dementia.

Ethical concerns in caring for elderly patients with cognitive limitations: a capacity-adjusted shared decision-making approach. Mrs. A is a pleasant seventy-seven-year-old widow with an increasingly symptomatic right knee that has markedly limited her activities in the past year. Mrs. A's daughter, who lives in town, urged her to seek treatment. History, physical examination, and radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of end-stage knee arthritis. Dr. Z, the orthopaedic surgeon, presented total knee arthroplasty as a potential treatment option and provided detailed information on the surgery and recovery. Mrs. A indicated that if Dr. Z thinks that total knee arthroplasty is a good idea, she would agree to have the surgery. She lives alone and goes grocery shopping once a week, but her pain makes such endeavors frustrating for her. Her daughter visits regularly, takes her to medical appointments, and helps her with medications. Mrs. A has returned for a preoperative visit with Dr. Z, and her total knee arthroplasty has been tentatively scheduled for the following month. At this visit, Mrs. A notes that she wants to drive to the adjacent state to visit her son two weeks after the surgery and is glad she will have "a new knee" for that visit. When asked more questions about her understanding of the total knee arthroplasty and postoperative instructions, Mrs. A says Dr. Z can just talk to her daughter when she comes to pick her up from the appointment.

Impairment of memory and affect in a patient with reversible bilateral thalamic lesions due to internal cerebral vein thrombosis. A 39-year-old woman suffered from an extensive bilateral lesion in the region of the thalamus. The damage, caused by a primary thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins, turned out to be reversible to a considerable degree detected by repeated CT-and MR-imaging after 2, 4 and 9 months. In spite of the partial, structural recovery the patient remained severely impaired on both cognitive and affective levels. The key functions involved were an anterograde verbal and figural memory impairment, depressed arousal and attentional levels, affective flattening, lack of prosody and a depressive irritable mood. These findings illustrate that thalamic lesions of a certain extent not only influence memory functioning, but have in addition, severe consequences for emotional behavior.

Impairment of short-term memory in left hemispheric traumatic brain injuries. We report on two patients with traumatic lesions in the temporal and parietal lobes who demonstrated disturbances of short-term memory (STM) following improvement on the aphasia. Patient 1 was a 66-year-old right-handed man who presented to our hospital with a cerebral contusion. One admission we observed a Wernicke's aphasia with paraphasic jargon in this patient that resolved within 8 weeks. Patient 2 was a 35-year-old right-handed woman, with an acute subdural haematoma and a cerebral contusion, who underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. In this patient we noted a transient Wernicke's aphasia following the operation that improved within 3 months. Linguistically, the aphasia observed in each of these two patients was not a typical conduction aphasia because of the absence of paraphasia, and impairment of comprehension was unclear despite a decrease in performance on repetition tasks. Both verbal and non-verbal tasks suggested an impairment in STM. These findings suggest that involvement of the left hemisphere may cause disturbances in both verbal and non-verbal STM.

Dr. Z, the orthopaedic surgeon, presented total knee arthroplasty as a potential treatment option and provided detailed information on the surgery and recovery. Mrs. A indicated that if Dr. Z thinks that total knee arthroplasty is a good idea, she would agree to have the surgery. She lives alone and goes grocery shopping once a week, but her pain makes such endeavors frustrating for her. Her daughter visits regularly, takes her to medical appointments, and helps her with medications. Mrs. A has returned for a preoperative visit with Dr. Z, and her total knee arthroplasty has been tentatively scheduled for the following month. At this visit, Mrs. A notes that she wants to drive to the adjacent state to visit her son two weeks after the surgery and is glad she will have "a new knee" for that visit. When asked more questions about her understanding of the total knee arthroplasty and postoperative instructions, Mrs. A says Dr. Z can just talk to her daughter when she comes to pick her up from the appointment.




Question:
A 72-year-old man is brought in by his daughter who is concerned about his recent memory impairment. The patient’s daughter says she has noticed impairment in memory and functioning for the past month. She says that he has forgotten to pay bills and go shopping, and, as a result, the electricity was cut off due to non-payment. She also says that last week, he turned the stove on and forgot about it, resulting in a kitchen fire. The patient has lived by himself since his wife died last year. He fondly recalls living with his wife and how much he misses her. He admits that he feels ‘down’ most days of the week living on his own and doesn’t have much energy. When asked about the kitchen fire and problems with the electricity, he gets defensive and angry. At the patient’s last routine check-up 3 months ago, he was healthy with no medical problems. His vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient appears to have a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

[A] : Pseudodementia
[B] : Dementia
[C] : Delirium
[D] : Pick’s disease

Migratory nodules in the lung: lymphomatoid granulomatosis. A 45-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of non-productive cough, chest pain, fatigue and weight loss in the last 4 months. On physical examination moderate hepatosplenomegaly and crackles most notably on the basal region of the right lung were evident. Serial chest X-rays and computed tomographies revealed a migratory nodular infiltration pattern, changing in location and size in both the lungs. The histopathological diagnosis of the open lung biopsy was lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) with a marked angioinvasive lymphocytic perivascular and peribronchial infiltration pattern. In the immunohistochemical analyses LCA, CD-79, CD-20 were positive, while CD-30 was negative. No response could have been achieved under combination chemotherapy and the patient died from progressive disease. LG is a rare disease and a difficult diagnosis in the routine clinical practice. This report emphasises that, LG should be considered especially when there are migratory nodules of varying sizes in lungs.

[A case of hypoxemic acute bronchiolitis presenting with diffuse nodular shadows caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae]. A fifty year-old female who had previously been well presented with a productive cough and a high fever. Her initial chest X-ray film showed no abnormal lung shadows. Despite partial improvement of the fever and the serum level of acute phase reactant (CRP) in response to intravenous administration of piperacillin, she complained of increasing severity of cough and dyspnea. Follow-up chest X-ray films taken five days after therapy with piperacillin showed diffuse nodular shadows in the mid-to-lower lung fields bilaterally. Chest CT scan disclosed diffuse miliary nodules at the lung periphery and thickening of bronchovascular markings. Chest auscultation revealed late inspiratory coarse crackles and expiratory wheezing, and the patient's arterial oxygen tension was 61 mmHg. Suspected of suffering from primary atypical pneumonia, she was started on therapy with intravenous minocyclin (200 mg/day), two days after treatment her symptoms began improving significantly. Anti-mycoplasma antibody was found to be x 1280, and cold hemoagglutinin x 1024, establishing the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The patient's condition completely recovered following a one week treatment with minocyclin. We concluded that her respiratory infection was caused by piperacillin-sensitive mico-organism, and also Mycoplasma pneumoniae which brought about hypoxic acute bronchiolitis to the patient.

Granular cell tumor of the lung. A 46-year-old female with history of asthma, active smoking (20 pack-years), and schizophrenia was evaluated for a persistent asymptomatic pulmonary nodule. Her past medical history was notable for hypertension, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, abnormal uterine bleeding, multinodular thyroid gland, and vitamin D deficiency. Seven months before presentation, a chest radiograph (CXR) was obtained to evaluate unintended weight loss, and showed a 3 cm spiculated mass in the left lower lobe concerning for a primary lung malignancy. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) suggested that the left lower lobe mass corresponded to rounded atelectasis; however, at 6âmonth follow-up, low-dose chest CT scan revealed a 2.1âÃâ1.2 cm nodule within the central portion of the left lower lobe, with pleural thickening, and arising from or extending into the left lower lobe bronchus. The patient had no recent history of appetite change, exertional dyspnea, chronic cough, wheeze, fever, or other chest complaints. Her examination showed normal vital signs, oxygen saturation of 98% while inspiring room air, and an entirely normal lung and general physical examination, except for diminished breath sounds at the left base with no wheeze. An endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and endobronchial biopsy was performed.

A chest X-ray showed a tumorous mass in the right lower lung field and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent transbronchial lung biopsy, and was diagnosed as having a malignant tumor. Because a metastatic lesion was detected in the left lung filed, we opted for chemotherapy. The white blood cell count rose to 103,700/mm3 and 190,000/mm3 in the fifth and sixth month after hospitalization, respectively. The serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level by enzyme immunoassay exceeded 1000 pg/ml. The histological diagnosis of large cell carcinoma was made from the specimen obtained by percutaneous needle biopsy of the lung. The carcinoma cells in this specimen, showed positive staining with anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibody.

[Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia with diffuse nodular shadows and right hilar lymphadenopathy]. A 51-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of fever, a productive cough, and dyspnea. His chest X-ray film revealed diffuse reticulonodular shadows and right hilar lymphadenopathy. A chest CT scan revealed thickened bronchial walls and diffuse centriacinar or centrilobular nodular shadows. Serologic testing provided conclusive evidence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The diffuse pattern and hilar lymphadenopathy on chest X-ray films are uncommon in this disease, and they caused some uncertainty regarding the correct diagnosis. M. pneumoniae attaches to cells of the respiratory tract and produces a locally acting cytotoxin. Immunologic mechanisms have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. This case suggests that immunologic mechanisms are an important factor in diffuse lung lesions.

Alcohol consumption and risk of coronary heart disease in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study. To evaluate several aspects of the relationship between alcohol use and coronary heart disease in older adults, including beverage type, mediating factors, and type of outcome. Prospective cohort study. Four U.S. communities. Four thousand four hundred ten adults aged 65 and older free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Risk of incident myocardial infarction or coronary death according to self-reported consumption of beer, wine, and spirits ascertained yearly. During an average follow-up period of 9.2 years, 675 cases of incident myocardial infarction or coronary death occurred. Compared with long-term abstainers, multivariate relative risks of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.71-1.14), 0.93 (95% CI=0.73-1.20), 0.76 (95% CI=0.53-1.10), and 0.58 (95% CI=0.39-0.86) were found in consumers of less than one, one to six, seven to 13, and 14 or more drinks per week, respectively (P for trend=.007). Associations were similar for secondary coronary outcomes, including nonfatal and fatal events. No strong mediators of the association were identified, although fibrinogen appeared to account for 9% to 10% of the relationship. The associations were statistically similar for intake of wine, beer, and liquor and generally similar in subgroups, including those with and without an apolipoprotein E4 allele. In this population, consumption of 14 or more drinks per week was associated with the lowest risk of coronary heart disease, although clinicians should not recommend moderate drinking to prevent coronary heart disease based on this evidence alone, because current National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines suggest that older adults limit alcohol intake to one drink per day.

Context:
Alcohol's effects on the risk for coronary heart disease. Several studies have indicated that moderate drinkers have a lower risk of both nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal heart disease than do abstainers. To determine whether alcohol truly prevents coronary heart disease or whether other factors may contribute to this observed relationship, researchers conducted a systematic literature review and a combined analysis (i.e., meta-analysis) of 42 published studies. This analysis found that consumption of up to two drinks per day can promote changes in the levels of molecules that reduce the risk of heart disease while also increasing the levels of certain molecules that promote heart disease. Alcohol also may affect the risk of heart disease by acting on other various other molecules involved in a variety of physiological processes related to heart disease. Finally, the relationship between alcohol consumption and heart disease may be modulated by genetic factors.

The relationship between alcohol consumption and coronary heart disease (CHD) in various epidemiologic study designs is consistent, showing protection at &lt; or = 2 drinks per day, with an increase in risk of CHD in several studies at higher alcohol consumption levels. Studies of potential mediators of the effects of alcohol on CHD show beneficial effects on HDL cholesterol and some coagulation factors, but, at higher levels of consumption, adverse effects on blood pressure, arrhythmias, and the myocardium. Statistical modeling of pathways for alcohol's effect on coronary disease is consistent with a protective pathway via elevated HDL cholesterol and an adverse pathway through elevated blood pressure. Maximum benefit for CHD appears to be reached at only one drink daily. Given that alcohol is an intoxicating and potentially addictive substance with a high abuse potential, and given the high morbidity and mortality associated with heavier drinking, public health recommendations to consume alcohol are contraindicated.




Question:
Researchers are studying the relationship between heart disease and alcohol consumption. They review the electronic medical records of 500 patients at a local hospital during the study period and identify the presence or absence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed on the day of presentation. They find that there is a lower prevalence of acute coronary syndrome in patients who reported no alcohol consumption or 1 drink daily compared with those who reported 2 or more drinks.

Post-Acute Coronary Syndrome Alcohol Abuse: Prospective Evaluation in the ERICO Study. Some studies have indicated alcohol abuse as one of the contributors to the development of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease. However, this relationship is controversial. To investigate the relationship between post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) alcohol abuse in the Acute Coronary Syndrome Registry Strategy (ERICO Study). 146 participants from the ERICO Study answered structured questionnaires and underwent laboratory evaluations at baseline, 30 days and 180 days after ACS. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was applied to assess harmful alcohol consumption in the 12 months preceding ACS (30 day-interview) and six months after that. The frequencies of alcohol abuse were 24.7% and 21.1% in the 12 months preceding ACS and six months after that, respectively. The most significant cardiovascular risk factors associated with high-risk for alcohol abuse 30 days after the acute event were: male sex (88.9%), current smoking (52.8%) and hypertension (58.3%). Six months after the acute event, the most significant results were replicated in our logistic regression, for the association between alcohol abuse among younger individuals [35-44 year-old multivariate OR: 38.30 (95% CI: 1.44-1012.56) and 45-54 year-old multivariate OR: 10.10 (95% CI: 1.06-96.46)] and for smokers [current smokers multivariate OR: 51.09 (95% CI: 3.49-748.01) and past smokers multivariate OR: 40.29 (95% CI: 2.37-685.93)]. Individuals younger than 54 years and smokers showed a significant relation with harmful alcohol consumption, regardless of the ACS subtype.

Alcohol, coronary heart disease, and total mortality. The dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption, coronary heart disease, and total mortality was examined. The results indicated that moderate consumers (1 to 2 drinks/day) were at a lower risk of coronary heart disease than nonconsumers or heavy consumers. Evaluation of total mortality in relationship to alcohol consumption reveals that a similar U-shaped relationship to longevity exists.

Alcohol consumption and risk of coronary heart disease in older adults: the Cardiovascular Health Study. To evaluate several aspects of the relationship between alcohol use and coronary heart disease in older adults, including beverage type, mediating factors, and type of outcome. Prospective cohort study. Four U.S. communities. Four thousand four hundred ten adults aged 65 and older free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Risk of incident myocardial infarction or coronary death according to self-reported consumption of beer, wine, and spirits ascertained yearly. During an average follow-up period of 9.2 years, 675 cases of incident myocardial infarction or coronary death occurred. Compared with long-term abstainers, multivariate relative risks of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.71-1.14), 0.93 (95% CI=0.73-1.20), 0.76 (95% CI=0.53-1.10), and 0.58 (95% CI=0.39-0.86) were found in consumers of less than one, one to six, seven to 13, and 14 or more drinks per week, respectively (P for trend=.007). Associations were similar for secondary coronary outcomes, including nonfatal and fatal events. No strong mediators of the association were identified, although fibrinogen appeared to account for 9% to 10% of the relationship. The associations were statistically similar for intake of wine, beer, and liquor and generally similar in subgroups, including those with and without an apolipoprotein E4 allele. In this population, consumption of 14 or more drinks per week was associated with the lowest risk of coronary heart disease, although clinicians should not recommend moderate drinking to prevent coronary heart disease based on this evidence alone, because current National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines suggest that older adults limit alcohol intake to one drink per day.


Alcohol's effects on the risk for coronary heart disease. Several studies have indicated that moderate drinkers have a lower risk of both nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal heart disease than do abstainers. To determine whether alcohol truly prevents coronary heart disease or whether other factors may contribute to this observed relationship, researchers conducted a systematic literature review and a combined analysis (i.e., meta-analysis) of 42 published studies. This analysis found that consumption of up to two drinks per day can promote changes in the levels of molecules that reduce the risk of heart disease while also increasing the levels of certain molecules that promote heart disease. Alcohol also may affect the risk of heart disease by acting on other various other molecules involved in a variety of physiological processes related to heart disease. Finally, the relationship between alcohol consumption and heart disease may be modulated by genetic factors.

An 18-Year-Old With Acute-on-Chronic Abdominal Pain. An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

Underdiagnosed and undertreated colorectal cancer tops liability list. A morbidly obese 42-year-old man complained to his primary care physician of pain in the right lower abdomen and groin that was aggravated by standing and walking. The general exam was unremarkable except for some tenderness on deep palpation of the right groin area. An abdominal examination was unsatisfactory because of obesity. The physician suggested the possibility of a right inguinal hernia, but was reluctant to commit to this diagnosis because of the poor abdominal exam. He charted "Impression: possible right inguinal hernia. 1) lose weight, 2) Donnatal AC &amp; HS." Eight weeks after the initial visit, the patient returned with the same complaints. Both the exam and vitals were unchanged from the previous visit. Six months later the patient's weight and abdominal exam remained the same, but his pain was worse. He reported that he had bright red blood in his stool twice. A rectal exam was essentially normal, though a fecal test was guaiacpositive. The patient was immediately referred to a local surgeon for consultation. After routine colon prep, the surgeon performed a flexible sigmoidoscopy. He found a lesion. The pathology report noted an adenocarcinoma of the colon. A left colectomy revealed some serosal involvement and several positive mesenteric nodes. Three months after the surgery, the patient sued the original family physician, alleging delay of diagnosis. The plaintiff supported the claim with a statement from the attending surgeon that said the family physician negligently tested and followed up with the patient.

As the week progressed the pain became constant and radiated to the back. The intensity of the abdominal pain increased to 10 out of 10. The patient reported some relief from her pain while lying in the prone position. Initially the pain was associated with loose stools for several days. The loose stools resolved spontaneously and then the patient began to experience nausea and vomiting. Her medications included lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide which she had been taking for the past five months. She had no history of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drug use.


A 67-Year-Old Woman With Abdominal Pain and Dyspnea. A 67-year-old woman presented to her primary physician with a year of periumbilical abdominal discomfort with diarrhea, bloating, and unintentional weight loss. While undergoing workup for the abdominal pain, she presented to the ED with dyspnea that worsened over a few weeks. She had no associated chest pain, lower extremity edema, fevers, or chills, but endorsed orthopnea. The patient's medical history included hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. Her family history was significant for coronary disease in her father and hypertension in her mother. She had no recent travel; she is a nonsmoker and rare alcohol drinker. She worked in administration.


An 18-Year-Old With Acute-on-Chronic Abdominal Pain. An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.




Question:
A 38-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for abdominal pain. He reports that he has had a dull, burning pain for several months that has progressively gotten worse. He also notes a weight loss of about five pounds over that time frame. The patient endorses nausea and feels that the pain is worse after meals, but he denies any vomiting or diarrhea. He has a past medical history of hypertension, and he reports that he has been under an unusual amount of stress since losing his job as a construction worker. His home medications include enalapril and daily ibuprofen, which he takes for lower back pain he developed at his job. The patient drinks 1-2 beers with dinner and has a 25-pack-year smoking history. His family history is significant for colorectal cancer in his father and leukemia in his grandmother. On physical exam, the patient is moderately tender to palpation in the epigastrium. A fecal occult test is positive for blood in the stool.

Which of the following in the patient’s history is most likely causing this condition?

[A] : Physiologic stress
[B] : Alcohol use
[C] : Medication use
[D] : Family history of cancer

Evolution of sexual functioning of men through treated and untreated depression. Depression as well as a treatment by antidepressant are factors that may interfere with sexuality. Due to this complex relationship between depression, antidepressant and sexuality, it is difficult to incontestably establish the exclusive accountability of a treatment or of a psychiatric disorder on sexual dysfunctions. The main purpose of the SADD (for Sexuality, Anti-Depressant and Depression) study is to evaluate sexual dysfunctions in depressed men treated with antidepressant or not. Participants of this transversal, observational study were men aged over 18 years old, suffering from unipolar major depressive disorder and treated by a psychiatrist, with or without antidepressant. Assessment of sexual functioning through three times: euthymia (before depression), untreated depression and treated depression if applicable was performed based on the ASEX scale. Seventy patients were included. Eight percent of euthymic patients presented a sexual dysfunction (average score on the ASEX=12.4) whereas 56% of untreated patients presented a sexual dysfunction (average total score on the ASEX=17.7) and 62% (34/55) of patients treated with antidepressant (average total score on ASEX=18.5) (P&lt;0.001). Sexual functioning of men receiving treatment is not significantly different to that among men not receiving any antidepressant, even if patients treated with antidepressant reported that they had a better mood than those untreated. Our results reveal a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction within the framework of major depressive disorder and its treatment and underlines the complex relationship between major depressive disorder, antidepressant and sexuality.

What happens next?: a claims database study of second-line pharmacotherapy in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who initiate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. The objective of this research was to examine treatment patterns and health-care costs associated with second-step pharmacotherapy in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who initiated monotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) in 2010. This claims database study analyzed patients diagnosed with MDD who were prescribed a monotherapy SSRI, with the first prescription identified as the index date. Patients were required to be â¥18Â years old, to have continuous insurance coverage from 1Â year prior (pre-index) through 1Â year post (post-index) from the index date, and to have not received an antidepressant in the pre-index period. The analyses are descriptive of the patient characteristics, initial SSRI prescribed, most commonly prescribed second-step therapies, and annualized health-care costs. The identified patients (Nâ=â5,012) were predominantly female (65.2%) with a mean age of 41.9Â years. The most frequent index SSRIs were citalopram (30.1%) and sertraline (27.5%), and 52.9% of patients were prescribed a second-step pharmacotherapy during the post-index period. Add-on therapy occurred twice more frequently than switching treatments, with either anxiolytics (40.2%) or antidepressants (37.1%) as the most common classes of add-on pharmacological therapies. Patients who added a second medication or switched therapies had higher annualized medical costs compared with patients who continued their index SSRI or discontinued treatment. For patients who were initially treated with an SSRI therapy, approximately half were prescribed a second-step treatment. In this comprehensive claims analysis, many of these patients experienced the addition of second medication, rather than switching to a new therapy. Given the type of medications used, it is possible that second-step interventions were targeted toward resolution of residual symptoms; however, this work is limited by the use of claims data without information on dosing or clinical symptoms, side effects, or response. Findings from this study set the expectation that physicians and patients will most likely need to partner for additional interventions in order to achieve remission.

Natural health products, dietary minerals and over-the-counter medications as add-on therapies to antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder: a review. Given the moderate efficacy of the currently available antidepressants (ADs) in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), the identification of agents that are both able to enhance the effectiveness of ADs and have a good safety profile is a reasonable task for current psychopharmacology. In addition to the well-known drugs (second-generation antipsychotics, levothyroxine, dopaminergic agents, etc.) for augmentation, investigations suggest that several nutraceuticals and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs may be effective and safe as adjunct therapeutic agents to conventional ADs. To identify such active ingredients we first performed a systematic literature search using PubMed and then conducted both backward and forward citation searches. For the PubMed search, we used the following combinations of keywords: 1) "adjunctive" + "therapy" + "antidepressant"; 2) "add-on" + "therapy" + "antidepressant"; 3) "supplementation" + "therapy" + "antidepressant". As a result of those efforts, we found more than 20 agents (e.g. S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine; folate; Ï-3 fatty acids; curcumin; N-acetylcysteine; saffron; 5-hydroxytryptophan; NSAIDs) that are supposedly effective in the augmentation of standard AD treatment. We discussed the possible mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of those agents, as well as the preclinical and clinical evidence for their efficacy as stand-alone and adjunct treatments for MDD.

Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtapazine results in differential brain activation by visual erotic stimuli in patients with major depressive disorder. The objective of this study was to identify patterns of brain activation elicited by erotic visual stimuli in patients treated with either Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) or mirtazipine. Nine middle-aged men with major depressive disorder treated with an SSRI and ten middle-aged men with major depressive disorder treated with mirtazapine completed the trial. Ten subjects with no psychiatric illness were included as a control group. We conducted functional brain magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while a film alternatively played erotic and non-erotic contents for 14 minutes and 9 seconds. The control group showed activation in the occipitotemporal area, anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus. For subjects treated with SSRIs, the intensity of activity in these regions was much lower compared to the control group. Intensity of activation in the group treated with mirtazapine was less than the control group but grea-ter than those treated with SSRIs. Using subtraction analysis, the SSRI group showed significantly lower activation than the mirtazapine group in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the caudate nucleus. Our study suggests that the different rates of sexual side effects between the patients in the SSRI-treated group and the mirtazapine-treated group may be due to different effects on brain activation.

Treatment-resistant hypertension in a post-transplant patient with cystic fibrosis: a rare case of phaeochromocytoma. Phaeochromocytoma is a rare catecholamine-producing tumour. We present the case of phaeochromocytoma in a young man with a background history of a double-lung transplant for cystic fibrosis (CF). Clinical case: A 25-year-old man, with a background history of CF, CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and a double-lung transplant in 2012 was presented to the emergency department with crampy abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He was diagnosed with distal intestinal obstructions syndrome (DIOS). Contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 3.4 cm right adrenal lesion. This was confirmed by a subsequent MRI of adrenal glands that demonstrated moderate FDG uptake, suggestive of a diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. The patient was noted to be hypertensive with a blood pressure averaging 170/90 mm/Hg despite treatment with three different anti-hypertensive medications - amlodipine, telmisartan and doxazosin. He had hypertension for the last 3 years and had noted increasingly frequent sweating episodes recently, without palpitations or headache. Laboratory analysis showed elevated plasma normetanephrines (NMN) of 3167 pmol/L (182-867) as well as elevated metanephrines (MN) of 793 pmol/L (61-377) and a high 3-MT of 257 pmol/L (&lt;185). Once cathecholamine excess was identified biochemically, we proceeded to functional imaging to further investigate. MIBG scan showed a mild increase in the uptake of tracer to the right adrenal gland compared to the left. The case was discussed at a multidisciplinary (MDT) meeting at which the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma was made. Following a challenging period of 4 weeks to control the patient's blood pressure with an alpha-blocker and beta-blocker, the patient had an elective right adrenalectomy, with normalisation of his blood pressure post-surgery. The histopathology of the excised adrenal gland was consistent with a 3 cm phaeochromocytoma with no adverse features associated with malignant potential. Five to ten per cent of patients have a secondary cause for hypertension. Phaeochromocytomas are rare tumours, originating in chromaffin cells and they represent 0.1-1.0% of all secondary hypertension cases. Secondary causes should be investigated in cases where: Patient is presenting &lt;20 years of age or &gt;50 years of age, There is refractory hypertension, or There is serious end-organ damage present. Patients may present with the triad of headache, sweating and palpitations or more vague, non-specific symptoms. Patients with suspected phaeochromocytoma should have 24-h urinary catecholamines measured and if available, plasma metanephrines measured. Those with abnormal biochemical tests should be further investigated with imaging to locate the tumour. Medical treatment involves alpha- and beta-blockade for at least 2 to 3 weeks before surgery as well as rehydration. There is a possibility of relapse so high-risk patients require life-long follow-up.

Context:
Proarrhythmia with class III antiarrhythmic drugs: definition, electrophysiologic mechanisms, incidence, predisposing factors, and clinical implications. Antiarrhythmic drugs can and do induce unexpected and sometimes fatal reactions by either producing new symptomatic arrhythmias or by aggravating existing arrhythmias. The definition of proarrhythmia has changed since controlled clinical studies showed a dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and mortality. The nature of proarrhythmic reactions is linked to the electrophysiologic effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs. Whereas Class I agents without accompanying effects on repolarization generally produce ventricular tachycardia (often incessant) or fibrillation, Class III agents typically produce torsades de pointes that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. The precise mechanism of torsades de pointes is not fully elucidated, although early after-depolarization and increases in spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization are likely possibilities. Proarrhythmic risk is lowest for amiodarone and is probably related to the drug's complex electrophysiologic profile. The incidence of torsades with sotalol increases with dose and the baseline values of the QT interval; the incidence with d-sotalol and other pure Class III agents remains unclear. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate this are under way. The fact that d-sotalol increases mortality in postinfarction patients suggests that it may possibly be a common property of most, if not all, pure Class III compounds. The ongoing clinical trials with various Class III agents are likely to provide the critical information on this important therapeutic issue.

Emerging class III antiarrhythmic agents: mechanism of action and proarrhythmic potential. The goal of developing an antiarrhythmic agent effective against malignant ventricular arrhythmias while maintaining a low side-effect profile remains elusive. The class III drugs amiodarone and sotalol are the best available agents. However, both drugs possess properties outside the realm of a pure class III effect, and their use is limited by a variety of dose-related side effects. There are several drugs with more selective class III properties currently in development. This review provides an overview of the optimal characteristics of an effective theoretical class III drug and a summary of the properties of a number of class III drugs under active investigation. An ideal class III antiarrhythmic agent for a reentrant arrhythmia should provide use-dependent prolongation of the action potential duration with slow onset and rapid offset kinetics. This drug would prolong the effective refractory period of cardiac tissue selectively at the rapid heart rates achieved during ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation with a delayed onset of action, and a rapid resolution of its effects on resumption of physiologic heart rates. With little effect on the refractory period at normal or slow heart rates, the ability to induce torsade de pointes would be lessened. In contrast to these ideal properties, most currently available and investigational agents have a reverse use-dependent effect on the action potential duration, producing more effects on the refractory period at slower heart rates. This property results in part from preferential block of the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr), with little or no effect on the slowly activating component (IKs). The development of a drug with favorable blocking kinetics that selectively blocks IKs may results in lower proarrhythmic events while still maintaining effective antiarrhythmic properties.

Comparison of the effect of class IA antiarrhythmic drugs on transmembrane potassium currents in rabbit ventricular myocytes. The blockade of cardiac transmembrane potassium channels, which is commonly seen with various antiarrhythmic drugs, plays an important role in their mechanism of action. We studied and compared the less-explored effects of three Class IA antiarrhythmics on the transient outward current (I(to)) and on the inward rectifier (I(kl)), ATP sensitive (I(KATP)), and delayed rectifier (I(K)) potassium currents in rabbit ventricular myocytes. Transmembrane currents were measured by applying the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique at 37 degrees C in myocytes enzymatically isolated from rabbit ventricular preparations. Quinidine (10 microM), disopyramide (10 microM), and procainamide (50 microM) were studied at concentrations close to or exceeding the therapeutic plasma level. All studied drugs significantly decreased the amplitude of I(KATP) (activated by 50 microM pinacidil) and I(K) currents. None of them influenced significantly I(kl). The amplitude of I(to) was decreased by quinidine and disopyramide but was not considerably altered by procainamide. The fast inactivation of I(to) was not changed by procainamide and was significantly accelerated by quinidine and disopyramide. Although quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide are all classified as Class IA antiarrhythmics, these drugs had different effects on various potassium currents, which may partially explain their distinct effect on repolarization in various cardiac tissues and on cardiac arrhythmias in clinical settings.

Characterisation of recombinant HERG K+ channel blockade by the Class Ia antiarrhythmic drug procainamide. Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs, including procainamide (PROC), are associated with cardiac sodium channel blockade, delayed ventricular repolarisation and with a risk of ventricular pro-arrhythmia. The HERG K(+) channel is frequently linked to drug-induced pro-arrhythmia. Therefore, in this study, interactions between PROC and HERG K(+) channels were investigated, with particular reference to potency and mechanism of drug action. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of HERG current (I(HERG)) were made at 37 degrees C from human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells stably expressing the HERG channel. Following activating pulses to +20 mV, I(HERG) tails were inhibited by PROC with an IC(50) value of approximately 139 microM. I(HERG) blockade was found to be both time- and voltage-dependent, demonstrating contingency upon HERG channel gating. However, I(HERG) inhibition by PROC was relieved by depolarisation to a highly positive membrane potential (+80 mV) that favoured HERG channel inactivation. These data suggest that PROC inhibits the HERG K(+) channel by a primarily 'open' or 'activated' channel state blocking mechanism and that avidity of drug-binding is decreased by extensive I(HERG) inactivation. The potency of I(HERG) blockade by PROC is much lower than for other Class Ia agents that have been studied previously under analogous conditions (quinidine and disopyramide), although the blocking mechanism appears similar. Thus, differences between the chemical structure of PROC and other Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs may help provide insight into chemical determinants of blocking potency for agents that bind to open/activated HERG channels.

Context:
A benefit-risk assessment of class III antiarrhythmic agents. With beta-blockers as the exception, increasing doubt is emerging on the value of antiarrhythmic drug therapy following a series of trials that have either shown no mortality benefit or even an excess mortality. Vaughan Williams class I drugs are generally avoided in patients with structural heart disease, and class IV drugs are avoided in heart failure. Unfortunately, arrhythmias are a growing problem due to an increase in the incidence of atrial fibrillation and sudden death. The population is becoming older and more patients survive for a longer time period with congestive heart failure, which again increases the frequency of both supraventricular as well as ventricular arrhythmias. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs act by blocking repolarising currents and thereby prolong the effective refractory period of the myocardium. This is believed to facilitate termination of re-entry tachyarrhythmias. This class of drugs is developed for treatment of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, and ibutilide are examples of class III drugs that are currently available. Amiodarone and sotalol have other antiarrhythmic properties in addition to pure class III action, which differentiates them from the others. However, all have potential serious adverse events. Proarrhythmia, especially torsade de pointes, is a common problem making the benefit-risk ratio of these drugs a key question. Class III drugs have been evaluated in different settings: primary and secondary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias and in treatment of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Based on existing evidence there is no routine indication for antiarrhythmic drug therapy other than beta-blockers in patients at high risk of sudden death. Subgroup analyses of trials with amiodarone and dofetilide suggest that patients with atrial fibrillation may have a mortality reduction with these drugs. However, this needs to be tested in a prospective trial. Similarly, subgroups that will benefit from prophylactic treatment with class III antiarrhythmic drugs may be found based on QT-intervals or - in the future - from genetic testing. Class III drugs are effective in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion. This is currently by far the most important indication for this class of drugs. As defined by recent guidelines, amiodarone and dofetilide have their place as second-line therapy except for patients with heart failure where they are first line therapy being the only drugs where the safety has been documented for this group of high risk patients.

Proarrhythmia with class III antiarrhythmic drugs: definition, electrophysiologic mechanisms, incidence, predisposing factors, and clinical implications. Antiarrhythmic drugs can and do induce unexpected and sometimes fatal reactions by either producing new symptomatic arrhythmias or by aggravating existing arrhythmias. The definition of proarrhythmia has changed since controlled clinical studies showed a dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and mortality. The nature of proarrhythmic reactions is linked to the electrophysiologic effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs. Whereas Class I agents without accompanying effects on repolarization generally produce ventricular tachycardia (often incessant) or fibrillation, Class III agents typically produce torsades de pointes that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. The precise mechanism of torsades de pointes is not fully elucidated, although early after-depolarization and increases in spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization are likely possibilities. Proarrhythmic risk is lowest for amiodarone and is probably related to the drug's complex electrophysiologic profile. The incidence of torsades with sotalol increases with dose and the baseline values of the QT interval; the incidence with d-sotalol and other pure Class III agents remains unclear. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate this are under way. The fact that d-sotalol increases mortality in postinfarction patients suggests that it may possibly be a common property of most, if not all, pure Class III compounds. The ongoing clinical trials with various Class III agents are likely to provide the critical information on this important therapeutic issue.


Emerging class III antiarrhythmic agents: mechanism of action and proarrhythmic potential. The goal of developing an antiarrhythmic agent effective against malignant ventricular arrhythmias while maintaining a low side-effect profile remains elusive. The class III drugs amiodarone and sotalol are the best available agents. However, both drugs possess properties outside the realm of a pure class III effect, and their use is limited by a variety of dose-related side effects. There are several drugs with more selective class III properties currently in development. This review provides an overview of the optimal characteristics of an effective theoretical class III drug and a summary of the properties of a number of class III drugs under active investigation. An ideal class III antiarrhythmic agent for a reentrant arrhythmia should provide use-dependent prolongation of the action potential duration with slow onset and rapid offset kinetics. This drug would prolong the effective refractory period of cardiac tissue selectively at the rapid heart rates achieved during ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation with a delayed onset of action, and a rapid resolution of its effects on resumption of physiologic heart rates. With little effect on the refractory period at normal or slow heart rates, the ability to induce torsade de pointes would be lessened. In contrast to these ideal properties, most currently available and investigational agents have a reverse use-dependent effect on the action potential duration, producing more effects on the refractory period at slower heart rates. This property results in part from preferential block of the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr), with little or no effect on the slowly activating component (IKs). The development of a drug with favorable blocking kinetics that selectively blocks IKs may results in lower proarrhythmic events while still maintaining effective antiarrhythmic properties.

Comparison of the effect of class IA antiarrhythmic drugs on transmembrane potassium currents in rabbit ventricular myocytes. The blockade of cardiac transmembrane potassium channels, which is commonly seen with various antiarrhythmic drugs, plays an important role in their mechanism of action. We studied and compared the less-explored effects of three Class IA antiarrhythmics on the transient outward current (I(to)) and on the inward rectifier (I(kl)), ATP sensitive (I(KATP)), and delayed rectifier (I(K)) potassium currents in rabbit ventricular myocytes. Transmembrane currents were measured by applying the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique at 37 degrees C in myocytes enzymatically isolated from rabbit ventricular preparations. Quinidine (10 microM), disopyramide (10 microM), and procainamide (50 microM) were studied at concentrations close to or exceeding the therapeutic plasma level. All studied drugs significantly decreased the amplitude of I(KATP) (activated by 50 microM pinacidil) and I(K) currents. None of them influenced significantly I(kl). The amplitude of I(to) was decreased by quinidine and disopyramide but was not considerably altered by procainamide. The fast inactivation of I(to) was not changed by procainamide and was significantly accelerated by quinidine and disopyramide. Although quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide are all classified as Class IA antiarrhythmics, these drugs had different effects on various potassium currents, which may partially explain their distinct effect on repolarization in various cardiac tissues and on cardiac arrhythmias in clinical settings.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 37-year-old woman presented with increasing abdominal pain and jaundice. Six weeks before admission, she developed persistent diarrhea and jaundice of the skin. She also bruised easily, and her gums bled. In the subsequent weeks, her appetite decreased, she was fatigued, and she had nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. She had a history of drinking 1 quart of vodka every day for 20 years, with brief periods of abstinence; she stopped consuming alcohol 11 days before admission because it no longer provided symptomatic relief. Her past medical history was also notable for depression, including a suicide attempt 4 years earlier. She did not smoke, use illicit drugs, or have unprotected sexual intercourse. She had received no blood transfusions and had not traveled recently. She took no medications, except for occasional ibuprofen. On physical examination, she was thin and deeply jaundiced, and she trembled and responded slowly to questions. She was afebrile but tachypneic, and she had orthostatic hypotension. Her HEENT examination was notable for scleral and sublingual icterus, as well as crusted blood on her gums and teeth. The jugular veins were flat. The cardiac examination revealed tachycardia (heart rate, 103 beats per minute) without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was nontender and protuberant, with hypoactive bowel sounds; the spleen was not palpable, and there was no fluid wave or caput medusae. The liver percussed to 18 cm, with a smooth edge extending 10 cm below the costal margin. She had cutaneous telangiectases on her chest and bilateral palmar erythema. There was no peripheral edema.

Untangling the etiology of ascites. Amyloidosis is a systemic disease known to affect a vast range of organs, including the liver, heart, and kidney. When infiltrating the liver, amyloidosis typically does not present with cirrhosis. Typical presentation includes hepatomegaly with some mild laboratory abnormalities. A 72-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of worsening abdominal, scrotal, and extremity swelling. He endorsed melanotic stools and intermittent dizziness with a 10-pound weight gain. Vitals revealed a blood pressure of 82/57 mmHg and a pulse of 83 beats/min with positive orthostatic changes. Mild bibasilar crackles were noted. His abdomen was moderately distended with a fluid wave present, but no hepatosplenomegaly was noted. He displayed anasarca with significant extremity and scrotal edema, but no jaundice, telangiectasias, or other stigmata of chronic liver disease were present. Liver function tests demonstrated a total bilirubin of 1.5 mg/dL (normal value: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL), AST 111 IU/L (normal value 5-34 IU/L), ALT 51 IU/L (normal value 5-55 IU/L), and GGT 583 U/L (12-64 U/L). Alkaline phosphatase was 645 U/L (40-150 U/L). Analysis of peritoneal fluid was consistent with portal hypertension due to liver disease. Given an atypical presentation of cirrhosis with unclear etiology, a biopsy was performed and revealed amyloid deposition. Liver disease can be due to various etiologies, many of which can present ambiguously. Although the most typical etiologies have been well defined, we present a case of an atypical presentation of hepatic amyloidosis discovered in a patient with ascites and without typical hepatomegaly.

[Acute hepatitis due to infectious mononucleosis in a 21-year-old-man]. A 21-year-old mole was admitted because of fever, fatigue, headache, pharyngitis, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, vomiting and dark urine for three days. The patient denied recent use of medicines or any other drug. His physical examination disclosed jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, whitish-yellow covered tonsils, bilateral anterior and posterior cervical lymph node enlargement associated with edema on the face and neck. Routine blood tests detected abnormalities in serum bilirubins and liver enzymes (total bilirubin: 14.5 mg/dl, direct-reacting bilirubin: 12.9 mg/dl, AST: 697 U/l, ALT: 619 U/l, alkaline phosphatases: 260 U/l, and GGT: 413 U/l). Serological tests showed negative results for viral hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, HIV-1 and HIV-2, and toxoplasmosis markers, while serology for recent infection by EBV was positive (IgM: 70 and 29 U/ml; EBV IgG: 25 and 156 U/ml). Although infrequently, EBV infection can cause acute hepatitis with accentuated cholestatic jaundice (5% of cases), which may constitute an additional diagnostic challenge for primary care physicians. The patient improved with supportive management and was discharged after 12 days. This case study might contribute to increase the suspicion index about acute hepatitis related to EBV.

A puzzle of hemolytic anemia, iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies in a 52-year-old male. A 52-year-old male with no significant past medical history reports increasing generalized fatigue and weakness for the past 2 weeks. Physical examination reveals jaundice and pallor without organomegaly or lymphadenopathy. His hemoglobin was 5.9âg/dL with a mean corpuscular volume of 87.1âfL and elevated red blood cell distribution width of 30.7%. His liver function test was normal except for elevated total bilirubin of 3.7âmg/dL. Serum LDH was 701âIU/L, and serum haptoglobin was undetectable. Further investigation revealed serum vitamin B12 of &lt;30âpg/mL with elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine level. In addition, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were low. The patient was diagnosed with hemolytic anemia secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency with concomitant iron deficiency anemia.


Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 37-year-old woman presented with increasing abdominal pain and jaundice. Six weeks before admission, she developed persistent diarrhea and jaundice of the skin. She also bruised easily, and her gums bled. In the subsequent weeks, her appetite decreased, she was fatigued, and she had nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. She had a history of drinking 1 quart of vodka every day for 20 years, with brief periods of abstinence; she stopped consuming alcohol 11 days before admission because it no longer provided symptomatic relief. Her past medical history was also notable for depression, including a suicide attempt 4 years earlier. She did not smoke, use illicit drugs, or have unprotected sexual intercourse. She had received no blood transfusions and had not traveled recently. She took no medications, except for occasional ibuprofen. On physical examination, she was thin and deeply jaundiced, and she trembled and responded slowly to questions. She was afebrile but tachypneic, and she had orthostatic hypotension. Her HEENT examination was notable for scleral and sublingual icterus, as well as crusted blood on her gums and teeth. The jugular veins were flat. The cardiac examination revealed tachycardia (heart rate, 103 beats per minute) without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen was nontender and protuberant, with hypoactive bowel sounds; the spleen was not palpable, and there was no fluid wave or caput medusae. The liver percussed to 18 cm, with a smooth edge extending 10 cm below the costal margin. She had cutaneous telangiectases on her chest and bilateral palmar erythema. There was no peripheral edema. The neurologic examination was notable for asterixis. Her stool was guaiac positive. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: hematocrit, 21.2%; white blood cells, 17,310/mm(3); ammonia, 42 micromol/L; serum creatinine, 3.9 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 70 mg/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; total bilirubin, 26.8 mg/dL; alanine aminotransferase, 14 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 77 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 138 U/L; prothrombin time, 103 seconds (international normalized ratio, 10.6); and urinary sodium, &lt;5 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed an elevated specific gravity and numerous muddy granular casts. Hepatitis A, B, and C serologies were negative. On abdominal ultrasound examination, there was no ascites, and the liver was echogenic. The portal and hepatic veins were patent, and the hepatic arteries were normal. The spleen measured 14 cm. What is the diagnosis?

Hepatocellular carcinoma presenting with Budd-Chiari syndrome, right atrial thrombus and pulmonary emboli. A 47-year-old patient presented with a two-week history of right upper quadrant pain, abdominal distention and new onset of shortness of breath. He had a history of intravenous drug abuse, no alcohol consumption and denied any known liver disease. On physical examination, he was tachypneic and had dullness in the flanks. His blood analysis at admission was as follows: hemoglobin, 12.9 g/dL; leukocyte count, 6,800/uL; platelet count, 63,000/uL; INR, 2.1; serum creatinine, 1.27 mg/dL; liver biochemistry tests were notable for marginal derangement, HBsAg was negative, anti-HCV was positive, HCV RNA was 367,498 IU/ml and alpha-fetoprotein was 992 mg/dL. Abdominal ultrasound showed a right liver lobe mass (13 cm in diameter) with inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis and mild peri-hepatic ascites. A 2D echocardiogram showed a presumed right atrial tumor thrombus. A multiphasic contrast-enhanced abdominal tomography (CT) confirmed a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with IVC obstruction and extensive tumoral thrombus to the right atrium (14 cm long).

Influence of elective versus emergent hospital admission on patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction is increasingly used as a health care quality metric, although satisfaction has been associated with more intense health care, including hospitalization. Whether the increased hospitalization associated with satisfaction is limited to elective (often discretionary) hospitalization is unknown. We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult respondents to the 2000 to 2010 US National Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (N = 50,978), including 2 years of panel data for each subject. Patient sociodemographics, health status, and hospital use were assessed in year 1, with hospital use categorized as elective or emergent hospitalization (based on whether it was preceded by an emergency visit). Year 2 patient satisfaction with health care providers was assessed using 5 items from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate adjusted associations between year 1 hospitalization and year 2 patient satisfaction quartile. Adjusting for sociodemographics, insurance status, availability of a usual source of care, chronic disease burden, health status, and year 1 office and prescription drug utilization, having â¥ 1 elective hospitalizations in year 1 was associated with higher year 2 satisfaction quartile (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.32). Emergent hospitalizations in year 1 were not associated with satisfaction quartile in year 2 (adjusted OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91-1.12). In a nationally representative sample, elective (but not emergent) hospitalizations were associated with subsequently higher overall satisfaction with health care providers, suggesting a nexus between discretionary hospital use and patient satisfaction.

The cost of satisfaction: a national study of patient satisfaction, health care utilization, expenditures, and mortality. Patient satisfaction is a widely used health care quality metric. However, the relationship between patient satisfaction and health care utilization, expenditures, and outcomes remains ill defined. We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult respondents (N = 51,946) to the 2000 through 2007 national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, including 2 years of panel data for each patient and mortality follow-up data through December 31, 2006, for the 2000 through 2005 subsample (n = 36,428). Year 1 patient satisfaction was assessed using 5 items from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey. We estimated the adjusted associations between year 1 patient satisfaction and year 2 health care utilization (any emergency department visits and any inpatient admissions), year 2 health care expenditures (total and for prescription drugs), and mortality during a mean follow-up duration of 3.9 years. Adjusting for sociodemographics, insurance status, availability of a usual source of care, chronic disease burden, health status, and year 1 utilization and expenditures, respondents in the highest patient satisfaction quartile (relative to the lowest patient satisfaction quartile) had lower odds of any emergency department visit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-1.00), higher odds of any inpatient admission (aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.23), 8.8% (95% CI, 1.6%-16.6%) greater total expenditures, 9.1% (95% CI, 2.3%-16.4%) greater prescription drug expenditures, and higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53). In a nationally representative sample, higher patient satisfaction was associated with less emergency department use but with greater inpatient use, higher overall health care and prescription drug expenditures, and increased mortality.

Patient Satisfaction with Clinicians and Short-Term Mortality in a US National Sample: the Roles of Morbidity and Gender. In a prior study, we found patient satisfaction was associated with mortality. However, that study included few deaths, yielding wide confidence intervals, was criticized for possible morbidity under-adjustment, and lacked power to explore sociodemographic moderation. To revisit the satisfaction-mortality association in a larger national sample, allowing more precise risk estimates, sequential morbidity adjustment, and exploration of sociodemographic moderation. Prospective cohort study. 2000-2015 Adult Medical Expenditures Panel Surveys (MEPS) respondents (Nâ=â92,952), each enrolled for 2 consecutive years. We used five Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS) items to assess patients' year 1 satisfaction with their clinicians. Death during the 2Â years of MEPS participation was determined by proxy report. We modeled the satisfaction-mortality association in sequential regressions: model 1 included sociodemographics, model 2 added health status (approximating recommended CAHPS adjustment), and model 3 added smoking status, disease burden, and healthcare utilization. Satisfaction was not associated with mortality in model 1. In model 2, higher satisfaction was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratios [95% CIs] for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (top) quartiles vs. 1st quartile: 1.28 (1.01, 1.62), Pâ=â0.04; 1.43 (1.12, 1.82), Pâ=â0.004; and 1.57 (1.25, 1.98), Pâ&lt;â0.001, respectively). The associations were not attenuated in model 3. There was a significant interaction between gender and satisfaction (F[3, 443]â=â3.62, Pâ=â0.01). The association between satisfaction and mortality was significant in women only, such that their mortality advantage over men was eliminated in the highest satisfaction quartile. The association of higher patient satisfaction with clinicians with higher short-term mortality was evident only after CAHPS-recommended adjustment, was not attenuated by further morbidity adjustment, and was evident in women but not men. The findings suggest that characteristics among women who are more satisfied with their clinicians may be associated with increased mortality risk.

Satisfaction with health care providers and preventive care adherence: a national study. Prior studies demonstrating associations between patient satisfaction with health care providers and preventive adherence were cross-sectional, limiting causal inferences. In cross-sectional and prospective analyses, we explored 3 hypotheses previously invoked to explain associations between satisfaction with providers and preventive adherence: (1) receiving preventive care increases satisfaction; (2) enhancing satisfaction increases preventive care; (3) satisfaction and adherence reflect patient characteristics, incompletely adjusted for in previous studies. We conducted 3 sets of logistic regression analyses employing 2000-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data: 1 cross-sectional and 2 prospective (baseline preventive care/follow-up year satisfaction, and baseline satisfaction/follow-up year preventive care), each set cumulatively adjusting for patient demographics, socioeconomics, morbidity, health care access, and medical skepticism. Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey items measured satisfaction with care from all providers in the preceding year. Preventive care examined included influenza vaccination and colorectal cancer, Papanicolaou, mammography, and prostate-specific antigen screening. In cross-sectional analyses adjusted for demographics (N = 74,792), highest (vs. lowest) quartile satisfaction was associated with preventive adherence [adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval)]: influenza vaccination 1.14 (1.07, 1.22); colorectal cancer screening 1.08 (0.99, 1.18); Papanicolaou screening 1.14 (1.04, 1.24); mammography screening 1.20 (1.11, 1.31); prostate-specific antigen screening 1.38 (1.25, 1.52). With full adjustment, associations of satisfaction with adherence were substantially attenuated, eliminated, or reversed. Prospective analyses yielded findings similar to the cross-sectional analyses. Cross-sectional and prospective associations between satisfaction with providers and preventive care adherence were similarly explained by patient characteristics. The findings question previously hypothesized causal relationships between satisfaction and preventive adherence.

A study of patient satisfaction at a tertiary care hospital in Hyderabad, India. The health care industry is fast changing and rapid transformation is required to meet the ever-increasing needs and demands of its patient population. Hospitals and health care providers are shifting from viewing patients as uneducated with few health care choices to educated consumers with many service demands and health care choices available. Modern health care organizations have identified the patient as an ultimate consumer of hospital services and understand the importance of patient satisfaction, establishing this as the yardstick. The present study is explorative in nature. This cross sectional study is aimed at collecting data regarding attitude of patients, assessing their satisfaction levels towards ease of getting care, facilities offered at the hospital, attitude of the staff at the hospital and overall status of the hospital. The research study revealed many insights regarding attributes that are important for doctors, nurses and hospitals which would match patient expectation and lead to satisfaction.

Context:
Influence of elective versus emergent hospital admission on patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction is increasingly used as a health care quality metric, although satisfaction has been associated with more intense health care, including hospitalization. Whether the increased hospitalization associated with satisfaction is limited to elective (often discretionary) hospitalization is unknown. We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult respondents to the 2000 to 2010 US National Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (N = 50,978), including 2 years of panel data for each subject. Patient sociodemographics, health status, and hospital use were assessed in year 1, with hospital use categorized as elective or emergent hospitalization (based on whether it was preceded by an emergency visit). Year 2 patient satisfaction with health care providers was assessed using 5 items from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey. We used ordinal logistic regression to estimate adjusted associations between year 1 hospitalization and year 2 patient satisfaction quartile. Adjusting for sociodemographics, insurance status, availability of a usual source of care, chronic disease burden, health status, and year 1 office and prescription drug utilization, having â¥ 1 elective hospitalizations in year 1 was associated with higher year 2 satisfaction quartile (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.32). Emergent hospitalizations in year 1 were not associated with satisfaction quartile in year 2 (adjusted OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.91-1.12). In a nationally representative sample, elective (but not emergent) hospitalizations were associated with subsequently higher overall satisfaction with health care providers, suggesting a nexus between discretionary hospital use and patient satisfaction.


The cost of satisfaction: a national study of patient satisfaction, health care utilization, expenditures, and mortality. Patient satisfaction is a widely used health care quality metric. However, the relationship between patient satisfaction and health care utilization, expenditures, and outcomes remains ill defined. We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult respondents (N = 51,946) to the 2000 through 2007 national Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, including 2 years of panel data for each patient and mortality follow-up data through December 31, 2006, for the 2000 through 2005 subsample (n = 36,428). Year 1 patient satisfaction was assessed using 5 items from the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey. We estimated the adjusted associations between year 1 patient satisfaction and year 2 health care utilization (any emergency department visits and any inpatient admissions), year 2 health care expenditures (total and for prescription drugs), and mortality during a mean follow-up duration of 3.9 years. Adjusting for sociodemographics, insurance status, availability of a usual source of care, chronic disease burden, health status, and year 1 utilization and expenditures, respondents in the highest patient satisfaction quartile (relative to the lowest patient satisfaction quartile) had lower odds of any emergency department visit (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-1.00), higher odds of any inpatient admission (aOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.23), 8.8% (95% CI, 1.6%-16.6%) greater total expenditures, 9.1% (95% CI, 2.3%-16.4%) greater prescription drug expenditures, and higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53). In a nationally representative sample, higher patient satisfaction was associated with less emergency department use but with greater inpatient use, higher overall health care and prescription drug expenditures, and increased mortality.


Patient Satisfaction with Clinicians and Short-Term Mortality in a US National Sample: the Roles of Morbidity and Gender. In a prior study, we found patient satisfaction was associated with mortality. However, that study included few deaths, yielding wide confidence intervals, was criticized for possible morbidity under-adjustment, and lacked power to explore sociodemographic moderation. To revisit the satisfaction-mortality association in a larger national sample, allowing more precise risk estimates, sequential morbidity adjustment, and exploration of sociodemographic moderation. Prospective cohort study. 2000-2015 Adult Medical Expenditures Panel Surveys (MEPS) respondents (Nâ=â92,952), each enrolled for 2 consecutive years. We used five Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS) items to assess patients' year 1 satisfaction with their clinicians. Death during the 2Â years of MEPS participation was determined by proxy report. We modeled the satisfaction-mortality association in sequential regressions: model 1 included sociodemographics, model 2 added health status (approximating recommended CAHPS adjustment), and model 3 added smoking status, disease burden, and healthcare utilization. Satisfaction was not associated with mortality in model 1. In model 2, higher satisfaction was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratios [95% CIs] for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (top) quartiles vs. 1st quartile: 1.28 (1.01, 1.62), Pâ=â0.04; 1.43 (1.12, 1.82), Pâ=â0.004; and 1.57 (1.25, 1.98), Pâ&lt;â0.001, respectively). The associations were not attenuated in model 3. There was a significant interaction between gender and satisfaction (F[3, 443]â=â3.62, Pâ=â0.01). The association between satisfaction and mortality was significant in women only, such that their mortality advantage over men was eliminated in the highest satisfaction quartile. The association of higher patient satisfaction with clinicians with higher short-term mortality was evident only after CAHPS-recommended adjustment, was not attenuated by further morbidity adjustment, and was evident in women but not men. The findings suggest that characteristics among women who are more satisfied with their clinicians may be associated with increased mortality risk.

Calcium nephrolithiasis and distal tubular acidosis in type 1 glycogen storage disease. A 36-year-old man was admitted to hospital due to right flank pain as a result of ureteral stones. He had been followed up for type 1 glycogen storage disease since the age of 11 years. He had four episodes of spontaneous stone birth during the previous 2 years, and each stone was composed mainly of calcium oxalate. Intravenous pyelography showed right hydronephrosis due to ureteral stones and bilateral multiple renal stones. We carried out transurethral ureterolithotripsy (TUL) on the right ureteral stones. The composition was a mixture of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated the association of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). These observations suggest that hypocitraturia and distal RTA are strongly correlated to recurrence of calcium nephrolithiasis. The patient's serum uric acid and urinary citrate excretion levels normalized after allopurinol and potassium citrate administration.

Initial presentation in psychiatry emergency room led to diagnosis of many urinary bladder stones in a male patient. The first case of man who presented to psychiatry emergency room for evaluation of abnormal behavior because of urinary stones was reported. Careful evaluation of patient led to a diagnosis of 37 urinary bladder stones in an Egyptian man with obstructive uropathy and metabolic defects in the form of hyperoxaluria and hypocitraturia. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of metabolic defects can lead to successful outcome in preventing reformation of urinary tract stones after surgery. A 61-year-old Egyptian man presented to psychiatry emergency room because he was found lying on floor in bathroom to urinate by his wife who thought her husband needed psychiatric evaluation. Patient gave history of frequent urination and dysuria on and off for 3 years. In the last 3 months before his presentation to emergency room, he got into a habit of lying down on his left side when he went to bathroom to urinate because it was easier for him to pass urine. Renal consultation requested because of presence of red blood cells in urinalysis. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple bladder stones. Twenty-four-hour urine collection showed low urinary citrate and high oxalate. Patient underwent open vesicolithotomy and removal of 36 stones. Stone analysis showed 75% uric acid and 25% calcium oxalate. Patient did very well after surgery, and 1 month later, he underwent transuretheral resection of prostate without any complications. Now patient has no difficulty passing urine and he has no recent attack of urinary tract infection. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of metabolic defects in men with urinary bladder stones would hopefully provide clinicians with the proper diagnostic tools to more specifically treat such patients with improved success in preventing reformation of urinary tract stones after surgery.

Clinical case of the month. A 29-year-old man with acute onset blurry vision, weakness, and gait abnormality. Stroke. A 29-year-old man, with no significant past medical history, was in his usual state of health until the afternoon of admission. The patient was seated at work eating lunch when he suddenly noticed that his vision became blurry. He covered his right eye and had no visual difficulty but noted blurry vision upon covering his left eye. At this point, the patient tried to stand up, but had difficulty walking and noticed he was "falling toward his left." Facial asymmetry when smiling was also appreciated. The patient denied any alteration in mental status, confusion, antecedent or current headaches, aura, chest pains, or shortness of breath. He was not taking any prescribed medications and had no known allergies. The patient denied any prior hospitalization or surgery. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and worked as a maintenance worker in a hotel. His family history is remarkable for his father who died of pancreatic cancer in his 50s and his mother who died of an unknown heart condition in her late 40s. Vital signs on presentation to the emergency department included temperature of 97.6 degrees F; respiratory rate of 18 per minute; pulse of 68 per minute; blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg; pulse oximetry of 99% on ambient air. His body mass index was 24 and he was complaining of no pain. The patient had no carotid bruits and no significant jugular venous distention. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. Neurological exam revealed left-sided facial weakness, dysarthria, and preserved visual fields. He was able to furrow his brow. Gait deviation to the left was present, and Romberg sign was negative. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout, and no other focal neurological deficit was present. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of stroke. Electrocardiogram, fasting lipid profile, computed tomography (CT) scan of head, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and neck, and transthoracic echo with bubble study were ordered. The initial head CT did not reveal bleeding. He was started on aspirin (ASA). On the second hospital day, the symptoms improved with resolution of dysarthria. His ataxia had also improved. Fasting lipid profile revealed mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. His head MRI revealed an acute right thalamic stroke. Echocardiography was significant only for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with transit of agitated saline "bubbles" from right atrium to left heart within three cardiac cycles (Figure). Doppler ultrasound of extremities revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. A complete resolution of symptoms occurred by the third hospital day. The patient was discharged on full dose aspirin and a statin and was referred for consideration of enrollment in a PFO closure versus medical management trial.

[Kidney full of stones, and an adrenal gland not quite normal]. A 31-year-old patient was followed for cystinuria, justifying CT scans. In 2006, a tissue mass of 3cm of the right adrenal gland, homogeneous, measured at 3.5cm in 2007 was noted. Blood pressure was 90/61mmHg, without orthostatic hypotension. During the clinical interview, no discomfort, sweat attack, headache, or palpitation was reported by the patient. Hormonal assays did not favor a primary hyperaldosteronism, or a hypercortisolism. Adrenal androgens were normal. 24h normetanephrines urinary excretion and metanephrines to creatinine ratio were elevated. One year later, the patient remained asymptomatic and normotensive. Plasma levels of normetanephrine and metanephrine were increased and highly pathological. The tumor was 5cm long and fixed individually on MIBG scintigraphy and PET scan. Right adrenalectomy was performed. A pheochromocytoma was confirmed histologically. The peculiarity here was the absence of symptoms, especially arterial hypertension. This currently affects up to 47% of cases, particularly in the context of incidentaloma investigations and family screening. Indeed, 35 to 40% of pheochromocytomas are associated with a germline mutation, justifying a genetic analysis in this patient. Genetic analysis did not show any mutation associated with pheochromocytoma. At a 6-year interval pheochromocytoma did not reappeared while BP increased reaching hypertension threshold. The only documented recurrence was lithiasis.

Trauma-induced filtering bleb formation and blebitis 40 years following a penetrating eye injury. A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of redness, irritation and blurred vision in his right eye, with a noticeable lesion superotemporally on the conjunctiva. He had a previous ocular history of penetrating glass injury in the right eye at the age of 9 years (40 years ago), of which no surgical intervention was performed at that time, as his parents did not seek medical attention. Slit lamp examination revealed a thin, conjunctival cystic bleb at 10 o'clock position with surrounding conjunctival injection and chemosis at close proximity to the site of previous ocular trauma. Investigations confirmed a diagnosis of trauma-induced filtering bleb with blebitis (bleb inflammation). The patient was treated with a combination of steroid and antibiotic drops for duration of 2âweeks. Subsequent follow-up revealed marked improvement of symptoms with reduced inflammation. Patient is being monitored regularly to prevent recurrence of blebitis and bleb associated complications.

Has decreased visual acuity associated with blunt trauma at the emergency department recovered? After blunt ocular trauma, many patients complain of visual disturbances at the emergency department of a hospital. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical manifestations and related factors of refractive change after blunt ocular trauma. This prospective study included 192 patients who had a history of monocular blunt trauma without any corneal or conjunctival open wound. None of them had a history of ocular disease or surgery. The examinations covered uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, refractive power, gonioscopy for anterior chamber angle, and A-scan ultrasonography for the measurement of axial length, anterior chamber depth, and the lens thickness. All the examinations were performed right after the trauma and then 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months later. The corneal topography was examined using an ORB scan right after the trauma and 1 month later. A myopic change of -2.01 Â± 2.27 diopters (D) in the injured eyes, compared with the sound eyes, was identified in 161 patients (83.9%), which showed an aspect of recovery as time passed of -0.14 Â± 0.51 D at 1 month after the trauma. The anterior chamber depth of the injured eyes, unlike that of the sound eyes, was significantly lower (P = 0.028), and the anteroposterior diameter of the lens of the injured eyes was significantly higher (P = 0.043). Blunt ocular trauma induced a significant myopic refractive change due to lens thickening and anterior chamber shallowing, which recovers spontaneously as time passes. Therefore, conservative management and examination of refractive change without artificial refractory correction would be a good choice for managing eyes with blunt trauma at an emergency department.

There was no history of preceding trauma, contact lens use, any eye drop usage or ocular surgery. Systemic history was not significant. Presenting uncorrected visual acuity in his right eye was counting fingers at 1 m and 20/200 in the left eye, with accurate projection of rays in both eyes. Slit lamp biomicroscopy showed the presence of bilateral diffuse conjunctival congestion, corneal ring infiltrates and epithelial defect with corneal oedema. Potassium hydroxide wet mount showed the presence of septate fungal hyphae. The patient was treated with topical 5% natamycin and 1% voriconazole over a period of 6 weeks. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/600 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye at 6-month follow-up.

Bilateral simultaneous infectious keratitis secondary to contact lens wear: an unusual case report with rare organisms. To report an unusual case of bilateral simultaneous hypopyon corneal ulcer in a contact lens wearer caused by polymicrobial infection with rare organisms. A case report of a 21-year-old soft contact lens wearer, who visited the emergency department with a 3-day history of pain, redness, decreased vision, photophobia, and tearing in both eyes. Examination showed a central corneal ulcer with hypopyon in both eyes. The cultures from corneal scrapings of both eyes, the contact lenses, and the contact lens solution showed heavy growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes species, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. The corneal ulcers healed completely with aggressive antibiotic treatment for 4 weeks. The best-corrected visual acuity after 6 months of follow-up was 20/400 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. The possibility of infectious keratitis should be kept in mind for an acute red eye in contact lens wearers, and appropriate initial management is essential for a successful outcome. It is believed that this is the first report of Flavobacterium meningosepticum as a causative organism in contact lens-related keratitis.

History was notable for similar eye redness and swelling without vision loss four months earlier, which improved following a brief course of prednisone. He endorsed mild eye irritation and tearing with bright lights. There was no history of fever, respiratory symptoms or trauma. Mother was medicating patient with leftover antibiotic eye drops x3 days without improvement. Physical examination on presentation notable for proptosis of left eye, lid, and periorbital swelling, mild scleral injection, and central vision loss in affected eye (20/200 OS, 20/25 OD). Extraocular movements and pupillary exam were normal. No corneal fluorescein uptake, abnormal cell, flare, or siedel sign were seen during slit lamp exam. Eye pressures were 24 mmHg in both eyes. Bedside ultrasonography was performed (Figure 1 showing retinal detachment, Ultrasound Video 2 showing detachment in orbital scan).

Trauma-induced filtering bleb formation and blebitis 40 years following a penetrating eye injury. A 49-year-old man presented to the emergency eye clinic with a 3-week history of redness, irritation and blurred vision in his right eye, with a noticeable lesion superotemporally on the conjunctiva. He had a previous ocular history of penetrating glass injury in the right eye at the age of 9 years (40 years ago), of which no surgical intervention was performed at that time, as his parents did not seek medical attention. Slit lamp examination revealed a thin, conjunctival cystic bleb at 10 o'clock position with surrounding conjunctival injection and chemosis at close proximity to the site of previous ocular trauma. Investigations confirmed a diagnosis of trauma-induced filtering bleb with blebitis (bleb inflammation). The patient was treated with a combination of steroid and antibiotic drops for duration of 2âweeks. Subsequent follow-up revealed marked improvement of symptoms with reduced inflammation. Patient is being monitored regularly to prevent recurrence of blebitis and bleb associated complications.


Has decreased visual acuity associated with blunt trauma at the emergency department recovered? After blunt ocular trauma, many patients complain of visual disturbances at the emergency department of a hospital. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical manifestations and related factors of refractive change after blunt ocular trauma. This prospective study included 192 patients who had a history of monocular blunt trauma without any corneal or conjunctival open wound. None of them had a history of ocular disease or surgery. The examinations covered uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, refractive power, gonioscopy for anterior chamber angle, and A-scan ultrasonography for the measurement of axial length, anterior chamber depth, and the lens thickness. All the examinations were performed right after the trauma and then 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months later. The corneal topography was examined using an ORB scan right after the trauma and 1 month later. A myopic change of -2.01 Â± 2.27 diopters (D) in the injured eyes, compared with the sound eyes, was identified in 161 patients (83.9%), which showed an aspect of recovery as time passed of -0.14 Â± 0.51 D at 1 month after the trauma. The anterior chamber depth of the injured eyes, unlike that of the sound eyes, was significantly lower (P = 0.028), and the anteroposterior diameter of the lens of the injured eyes was significantly higher (P = 0.043). Blunt ocular trauma induced a significant myopic refractive change due to lens thickening and anterior chamber shallowing, which recovers spontaneously as time passes. Therefore, conservative management and examination of refractive change without artificial refractory correction would be a good choice for managing eyes with blunt trauma at an emergency department.

Bilateral fungal keratitis with ring infiltrates: a rare scenario. A 12-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with chief complaints of pain, redness, discharge and diminution of vision in both eyes over the previous 20 days. There was no history of preceding trauma, contact lens use, any eye drop usage or ocular surgery. Systemic history was not significant. Presenting uncorrected visual acuity in his right eye was counting fingers at 1 m and 20/200 in the left eye, with accurate projection of rays in both eyes. Slit lamp biomicroscopy showed the presence of bilateral diffuse conjunctival congestion, corneal ring infiltrates and epithelial defect with corneal oedema. Potassium hydroxide wet mount showed the presence of septate fungal hyphae. The patient was treated with topical 5% natamycin and 1% voriconazole over a period of 6 weeks. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/600 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye at 6-month follow-up.

Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis in a 29-year-old woman with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax: case report. Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare, progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease that affects women of child-bearing age. It is characterized by the nonneoplastic proliferation of atypical smooth muscle cells around lymphatics, venules, and bronchioles. Patients with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis most commonly present with exertional dyspnea and a cough. Pneumothorax is almost always found on the initial chest radiograph. We report a case of a 29-year-old woman who presented with abrupt right chest pain and progressive dyspnea. Physical examination in the emergency department was significantly diminished breath sounds over the right lung, and a chest X-ray revealed a right-sided pneumothorax. She required a chest tube for complete lung re-expansion. On the sixth day of admission, left-sided pneumothorax occurred and another chest tube was inserted. She underwent high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax with the findings of numerous cysts evenly distributed throughout the parenchyma of both lungs. Bilateral thoracotomy with lung biopsies and pleurodesis were performed and the surgical findings confirmed the presence of multiple, small, pink-colored cystic lesions on the surfaces of both lungs. Pathological examination showed the characteristic findings of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

[Superior vena cava thrombosis after in vitro fertilization]. A 29-year-old female was admitted with the diagnosis of multiple deep vein thrombosis of the upper limbs and neck and pneumonia secondary to pulmonary embolism on the right side. Medical history revealed that in vitro fertilization with hormone stimulation had been carried out 5 weeks before. For ten days the patient had noticed a growing, painful swelling on the right side of her neck accompanied by difficulties in swallowing. Since this time she had experienced episodes of shortness of breath without chest pain. Clinical findings showed a soft and slightly painful swelling of the right side of the neck without dyspnoea or cyanosis at rest. Breath sounds were decreased over the right lower lung on auscultation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed complete obstruction of the subclavian and brachiocephalic vein on the right side and clots in the superior vena cava, left subclavian vein, bilateral internal jugular veins and the right axillar vein. Chest x-ray showed pleural effusion on the right side. As the seven-week pregnancy was found not to be viable anymore, fibinolysis with streptokinase was started under protection of a temporary cava filter. During the following hours the patient developed serious bleeding as a complication of this therapy and fibrinolysis had to be discontinued after 16 hours. In subsequent examinations the obstruction of the left internal jugular vein was unchanged but collaterals around the obstruction were noticed. The other veins affected were open, some with reduced flow. Several risk factors were found in the history of the patient such as smoking, immobilization, a positive family history, protein S deficiency and APC resistance. After 3 weeks of hospital therapy the patient was discharged under oral anticoagulation with coumarin. In vitro fertilization with hormonal stimulation may cause serious complications in patients with unknown coagulation disorders or with an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Risk factors for thromboembolism need to be ruled out carefully before starting the procedure.

In subsequent examinations the obstruction of the left internal jugular vein was unchanged but collaterals around the obstruction were noticed. The other veins affected were open, some with reduced flow. Several risk factors were found in the history of the patient such as smoking, immobilization, a positive family history, protein S deficiency and APC resistance. After 3 weeks of hospital therapy the patient was discharged under oral anticoagulation with coumarin. In vitro fertilization with hormonal stimulation may cause serious complications in patients with unknown coagulation disorders or with an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Risk factors for thromboembolism need to be ruled out carefully before starting the procedure.




Question:
A 29-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath and chest pain for the past week.

Alanine metabolism and gluconeogenesis in the rat. The metabolism of alanine and several other gluconegoneic substrates was studied in anesthtized fed and fasted rats, i.e., rats with low and high rates of gluconeogenesis. Glutamine was released by the hindquarter (muscle) in both groups, whereas lactate, pyruvate, and alanine were taken up in fed rats and were released during starvation. Despite this, blood levels of alanine, lactate, and pyruvate were diminished in fasting rats, suggesting increased extraction by liver. Treatment of fasted rats for 24 h with phloridzin caused glycosuria and secondarily led to hypoglycemia and an intensification of the chargesobserved with fasting, i.e., hyperketonemia, hyperglucagonemia, and increased gluconeogenesis (assessed by urea N excretion). Blood alanine was decreased, even though the release of alanine from muscle was increased. Pretreatment with triamcinolone and administration of exogenous alanine both attenuated the hypoglycemia and ketosis, It is concluded that 1) in states of heightened gluconeogenesis, alanine release from muscle may not keep pace with extraction by liver and blood alanine decreases; 2) the release of alanine, lactate, and pyruvate from muscle parallel each other suggesting common control factors; and 3) in the red state muscle is an important site of lactate disposition.

Hypoglycemia in patients with congenital muscle disease. Only a few small studies have previously reported episodes of hypoglycemia in children with neuromuscular diseases; however, there has been no broader investigation into the occurrence of hypoglycemia in children with congenital muscle disease (CMD). Pediatric patients enrolled in the CMD International Registry (CMDIR) with a history of hypoglycemia were included in this retrospective review. Hypoglycemic episodes and associated clinical and biochemical characteristics were characterized. Ten patients with CMD (5 with LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy) reported at least one episode of hypoglycemia beginning at an average age of 3.5âyears. Predominant symptoms included altered mental status and nausea/vomiting, and laboratory studies demonstrated metabolic acidosis and ketonuria, consistent with ketotic hypoglycemia. Patients with CMD may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia during fasting, illness, or stress due to their relatively low muscle mass and hence, paucity of gluconeogenic substrate. Clinicians should therefore maintain a high index of suspicion for hypoglycemia in this high-risk patient population and caregivers should routinely be trained to recognize and treat hypoglycemia.

[Pathogenesis of ketotic hypoglycemia (author's transl)]. 4 children with ketotic hypoglycemia (KH) showed during a fasting period over 24 hours significant higher decreases of serum alanine levels than normal controls. Insulin induced hypoglycemia was followed by only minimal increase of urine epinephrine secretion, while all controls showed more than 6 times higher increases. 2-desoxy-glucose-tests were pathological in all cases with KH. One can speculate, that there is a connection between the reduced availability of alanine and the adrenal medullary hyporesponsiveness. Epinephrine stimulates glycogenolysis in muscle cells. Lack of epinephrine reduces pyruvate production and subsequently alanine synthesis. Alanine however is essential for gluconeogenesis in liver cells especially during starvation. After some days administration of diazoxide the 2-desoxy-glucose-test was normalised in all patients. This observation could probably be of some interest in therapy of KH.

Context:
Amino acid and protein metabolism in diabetes mellitus. In normal man, the fasting state is characterized by release of alanine and glutamine from muscle and in situ muscle catabolism of branched chain amino acids (lecucine, isoleucine, and valine). The alanine released by muscle is utilized by the liver for gluconeogenesis. Muscle nitrogen repletion occurs during protein feeding primarily by means of selective hepatic escape and muscle uptake of branched chain amino acids in ingested protein. In the diabetic, amino acid catabolism is exaggerated in the fasting state as reflected by increased uptake of alanine by the liver for gluconeogenesis and accelerated branched chain amino acid catabolism in muscle. After protein feeding, uptake of branched chain amino acids by muscle is reduced and these amino acids accumulate in increased amounts in arterial blood. Protein feeding also exaggerates the hyperglycemia of diabetes by causing an increase in hepatic glucose production. Diabetes is thus characterized by accelerated protein catabolism during fasting as well as diminished nitrogen repletion and hyperglycemia after protein feeding. The hyperketonemia of diabetes may however, have a restraining influence on protein catabolism thereby reducing alanine availability for gluconeogenesis.

Amino acids as substrates in children with growth hormone deficiency and hypoglycemia. In order to investigate the role of amino acid (AA) substrates in the hypoglycemia associated with human growth hormone (hGH) deficiency, we measured 12-hour fasting blood glucose and total quantitative AA concentrations in 11 children with hGH deficiency during three study periods: (1) before hGH replacement; (2) after 12 months of hGH treatment; and (3) after discontinuation of hGH for three months. The results were compared to studies in 16 control subjects. Fasting blood glucose concentrations were significantly (P less than .05) lower in the hGH-deficient children prior to hGH treatment as compared to the control subjects (67.0 +/- 5.3 vs 80.7 +/- 5.3 mg/100 ml, mean +/- SE). Fasting total serum AA concentrations were similar in the patients and in the control subjects; however, after 12 months of hGH replacement, there was a significant (P less than .01) elevation of serum AA (2,750 +/- 170 vs 2,283 micromoles/liter). Fasting serum concentrations of alanine, glycine, arginine, and tryptophan were also significantly elevated (P less than .01) with hGH treatment; ornithine, tyrosine, lysine, methionine, and phenylalanine showed lesser elevations (P less than 0.5), whereas threonine decreased significantly (P less than 0.01). The fasting hypoglycemia seen with isolated hGH deficiency is not an AA substrate-limited disorder. The finding of increased concentrations of AA with hGH replacement suggests increased retention of nitrogen and synthesis of AA for gluconeogenesis due to availability of other substrates.

We describe a Caucasian man in his late 60s who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a history of cardiogenic shock secondary to an acute myocardial infarction. The patient's baseline serum creatinine levels were 0.9-1âmg/dL. On day 7 of the admission treatment with quetiapine was initiated due to a delirium episode. The next day the patient developed an erythematous-maculopapular rash and fever, with eosinophilia in the blood count. Over the following days the patient experienced an acute deterioration of kidney function requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. The skin lesions and eosinophilia resolved after withdrawal of quetiapine and systemic steroid therapy was administered. The patient was discharged from the ICU with a serum creatinine level of 2.6âmg/dL. Three months later, blood tests showed no recovery of the kidney function. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, this event would be classified as 'probable' DRESS syndrome and, based on the RegiSCAR scoring system, was classified as 'definite' DRESS syndrome.

Serum blood urea nitrogen as an independent marker of subsequent mortality among patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal to mildly reduced glomerular filtration rates. We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) would be associated with adverse outcomes independent of serum creatinine (sCr)-based estimates of kidney function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Although lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have prognostic significance among patients with ACS, estimates of GFR based on sCr may perform less accurately among patients with milder kidney dysfunction. In this population in particular, BUN, which can reflect increased proximal tubular reabsorption in addition to decreased GFR, may have independent prognostic value. Data were drawn from 9,420 patients with unstable coronary syndromes from Orbofiban in Patients With Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI)-16, a trial that excluded patients with sCr &gt;1.6 mg/dl or estimated creatinine clearance &lt;40 ml/min. Patients with elevated BUN were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had higher heart rates, lower systolic blood pressures, and an abnormal Killip class more often on admission. In univariate analyses, as well as in stratified and multivariable analyses including sCr-based estimates of GFR as a covariate, a stepwise increase in mortality occurred with increasing BUN (multivariable hazard ratio with BUN 20 to 25 mg/dl 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6; with BUN &gt;/=25 mg/dl 3.2 [95% confidence interval 2.2 to 4.7]) compared with BUN &lt;/=20 mg/dl. A higher BUN was also associated with increased mortality among strata of troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein concentrations. Among patients with unstable coronary syndromes and predominantly normal or mildly reduced GFR, an elevated BUN is associated with increased mortality, independent of sCr-based estimates of GFR and other biomarkers.

Physical examination revealed anemic conjunctivae and leg edema, but the urinary volume was preserved. Blood examination showed high BUN (64 mg/dl) and Cr levels (3.91 mg/dl). Urinary analysis showed proteinuria (1.05 g/day) and high BMG (14,434/microg/day) and NAG (4.55 U/day) levels, suggesting severe tubulointerstitial injury. On ultrasonography of the kidney, the bilateral kidneys showed marked swelling without hydronephrosis. To investigate the genesis of renal failure, we performed a renal biopsy. The specimen showed normal glomeruli, but a large number of cells infiltrated in the tubulointerstitial area with normal tubulointerstitial structure. The cells stained positively with anti-leukocyte antigen and L26 (B cell marker), and negatively with cytokeratin and UCHL-1 (T cell marker). These findings indicate that the interstitial cells were non-Hodgkin lymphoma with B cell diffuse large cells. Chemotherapy was performed with VAD (vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, dexamethasone) considering his renal dysfunction. To avoid tumor lysis syndrome after chemotherapy, hemodialysis was performed on days 1-4 after the initiation of chemotherapy. After a series of chemotherapy, the urinary volume increased and serum Cr levels decreased to 2 mg/dl. After additional therapy with 4 courses of CHOP, he improved and was discharged on day 180 after admission.

[A case of renal failure due to primary cholesterol atheroembolism]. We report a patient presenting rapid deterioration of renal function due to primary cholesterol atheroembolism. The patient was 75-year-old hypertensive male and was admitted to a hospital because of rt. hemiplegia which developed 2 weeks earlier. On admission, his blood pressure was 200/100 mmHg and serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dl with urinalysis 1+ both for protein and hematuria. 2 weeks later, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor, delapril 15 mg/day) was given to control high blood pressure. Immediately after this medication, his renal failure rapidly progressed with a fall in blood pressure (110/60 mmHg) and oliguria (100 ml/day). Although he was transferred to our hospital and was treated with hemodialysis, he died of an attack of acute myocardial infarction in a week. At post-mortem examination, microscopic findings of the kidney disclosed numerous occlusions of medium-sized artery by cholesterol emboli. These emboli were also observed in other organs, but not so prominent as in the kidney. The coronary arteries exhibited severe sclerosis. In this presented case, acute deterioration of renal function was caused by ACE-inhibitor, although which was administered in a volume depleted condition. Therefore, further study would be necessary whether or not ACE-inhibitors predispose the patients with this disease to acute renal failure.

Acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: perils and promise. A 62-year-old man with cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C and chronic alcohol abuse was admitted to the intensive care unit with hematemesis and mental status changes. Physical examination showed ascites and stigmata of chronic liver disease. Blood pressure was noted as 87/42 mm Hg and laboratory studies showed a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 84 mL/min/1.73 m(2) calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, a serum sodium level of 123 mEq/L, a total serum bilirubin level of 4.3 mg/dL, and an international normalization ratio of 1.6. The patient was resuscitated with packed red blood cells and fresh-frozen plasma and bleeding was controlled. However, on the third day of admission, creatinine level increased to 1.5 mg/dL. Examination of urine sediment showed 1 to 5 bilirubin-stained granular casts per high-powered field and a few renal tubular epithelial cells. The urine sodium level was 21 mEq/L and the fractional excretion of sodium was 0.43%.


Permanent renal sequelae secondary to drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome induced by quetiapine. We describe a Caucasian man in his late 60s who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a history of cardiogenic shock secondary to an acute myocardial infarction. The patient's baseline serum creatinine levels were 0.9-1âmg/dL. On day 7 of the admission treatment with quetiapine was initiated due to a delirium episode. The next day the patient developed an erythematous-maculopapular rash and fever, with eosinophilia in the blood count. Over the following days the patient experienced an acute deterioration of kidney function requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. The skin lesions and eosinophilia resolved after withdrawal of quetiapine and systemic steroid therapy was administered. The patient was discharged from the ICU with a serum creatinine level of 2.6âmg/dL. Three months later, blood tests showed no recovery of the kidney function. According to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, this event would be classified as 'probable' DRESS syndrome and, based on the RegiSCAR scoring system, was classified as 'definite' DRESS syndrome.

Serum blood urea nitrogen as an independent marker of subsequent mortality among patients with acute coronary syndromes and normal to mildly reduced glomerular filtration rates. We hypothesized that elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) would be associated with adverse outcomes independent of serum creatinine (sCr)-based estimates of kidney function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Although lower glomerular filtration rates (GFR) have prognostic significance among patients with ACS, estimates of GFR based on sCr may perform less accurately among patients with milder kidney dysfunction. In this population in particular, BUN, which can reflect increased proximal tubular reabsorption in addition to decreased GFR, may have independent prognostic value. Data were drawn from 9,420 patients with unstable coronary syndromes from Orbofiban in Patients With Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI)-16, a trial that excluded patients with sCr &gt;1.6 mg/dl or estimated creatinine clearance &lt;40 ml/min. Patients with elevated BUN were older, had a higher prevalence of comorbidities, and had higher heart rates, lower systolic blood pressures, and an abnormal Killip class more often on admission. In univariate analyses, as well as in stratified and multivariable analyses including sCr-based estimates of GFR as a covariate, a stepwise increase in mortality occurred with increasing BUN (multivariable hazard ratio with BUN 20 to 25 mg/dl 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6; with BUN &gt;/=25 mg/dl 3.2 [95% confidence interval 2.2 to 4.7]) compared with BUN &lt;/=20 mg/dl. A higher BUN was also associated with increased mortality among strata of troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein concentrations. Among patients with unstable coronary syndromes and predominantly normal or mildly reduced GFR, an elevated BUN is associated with increased mortality, independent of sCr-based estimates of GFR and other biomarkers.

Context:
Diagnostic approach to palpitations. Palpitations-sensations of a rapid or irregular heartbeat-are most often caused by cardiac arrhythmias or anxiety. Most patients with arrhythmias do not complain of palpitations. However, any arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations should be considered as potentially more serious if they are associated with dizziness, near-syncope, or syncope. Nonarrhythmic cardiac problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, and congestive heart failure, and noncardiac problems, such as hyperthyroidism, vasovagal syncope, and hypoglycemia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations also can result from stimulant drugs, and over-the-counter and prescription medications. No cause for the palpitations can be found in up to 16 percent of patients. Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring usually is indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.

A 67-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) presented to his physician with symptoms of episodic, nighttime palpitations and excessive daytime sleepiness. Four years prior he underwent radiofrequency ablation after a confirmed diagnosis of AF with subsequent resolution of his palpitations. His palpitations returned approximately 1 year following the ablation. These events would occur only at night and awake him from sleep. Holter monitoring showed baseline sinus rhythm with multiple episodes of AF with rates of 75 to 169 beats/min. These events were all nocturnal and correlated with the symptom diary; episodes ranged from 45Â min to 2 h. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and ejection fraction with a mildly enlarged right atrium (4.38Â cm) and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

Limited clinical utility of Holter monitoring in patients with palpitations or altered consciousness: analysis of 8973 recordings in 7394 patients. To determine the clinical utility of 24 hour Holter monitoring by measuring the frequency of candidate arrhythmias recorded during the investigation of palpitations and altered consciousness. Of 9,729 Holter recordings, reports were available in 8,973 (92.2%) performed in the 7394 patients who comprise the study group. The mean age of the study group was 66 +/- 19 years and 56.4% were women. The most common indications were altered consciousness (41.7%) and palpitations (36.2%). Among patients with palpitations and sinus rhythm (n=2688), recordings were normal in 2247 (83.6%). Abnormalities included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF, 6.6%), narrow complex tachycardia (NCT, 2.8%) nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT/VT, 2.6%). Among patients with altered consciousness (n=3075), recordings were normal in 2589 (84.2%). Abnormalities included PAF (9.5%), NCT (2.6%), NSV/VT (0.2%), pause &gt;2.8s (2.2%) and high degree AV block (1.3%). The diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring was particularly low in patients aged &lt; or =50 years, of whom 93.1% had palpitations and 95.3% had altered consciousness had normal recordings. The diagnostic utility of Holter monitoring in patients being investigated for palpitations and altered consciousness is very limited, particularly in young patients for whom alternative diagnostic methods should be considered.

Atrial fibrillation presented with syncope in a jet pilot during daily briefing on squadron. Syncope may be the initial clinical presentation of atrial fibrillation (AF) and has a great potential for incapacitation during flight. Herein is presented the case of a jet pilot who had paroxysmal palpitations accompanied with presyncope which progressed to syncope and was found to be associated with AF. A 23-yr-old male jet pilot had a sudden syncope at the fifth minute of his presentation during the daily flight briefing. After he regained consciousness, he was transferred to the intensive care unit of the military hospital. His medical history revealed two episodes of syncope which resulted in spontaneous recovery and were not reported to the flight surgeon. He had no abnormal findings on his physical examination except heart rate, which was irregular and 110 bpm with a rapid ventricular response. His diagnosis was AF. Laboratory tests, including thyroid hormones, CBC, transthoracic echocardiography, ultrasonography of the abdomen, chest X-rays, and also a tilt table test, were normal. He had completely normal findings on 24-h ECG Holter monitoring except rare ventricular extrasystoles and had a negative treadmill stress test. AF spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm during the follow-up in the intensive care unit. He was temporarily grounded and returned to flying duties after a 3-mo follow-up period without any recurrent arrhythmia. Syncope has various mechanisms and etiologies, and also a benign prognosis on the ground. However, not only vasovagal syncope, but also AF may be among the frequent causes of syncope in aviators and pilots, as was the case in the current study.

[Natural history of patients with isolated atrial fibrillation]. Sixty three patients (pts) (aged less than or equal to 50 years) with a history of "lone" atrial fibrillation (AF) and normal heart size at radiological examination were followed-up for a mean period of 95 months (range 1-360). The arrhythmia remained paroxysmal in 43 pts, became chronic in 13, while in 7 could not be reverted to sinus rhythm at the time of first observation. Clinical examination was normal in 58 pts; in 23 echocardiography disclosed mild abnormalities. In 2 pts auscultation revealed a mid-systolic apical click, i n one a mid-systolic murmur and in 2 click and murmur together. These findings were correlated to slightly pathological echocardiographic patterns. M-mode and B-mode echocardiography yielded normal results in 35 pts and showed minor pathological findings in 28 (16 with paroxysmal AF and 12 with chronic AF). Thyroid hormones, tested in 58 pts, were within normal limits in 53, showed decreased T4 in 2 and increased T3 in 3 (2 of whom in treatment with amiodarone). During the follow-up period, no patient had a deterioration of the clinical status from the cardiovascular point of view. However, one patient suffered an episode of cerebral embolism, with rapid resolution, and one a cerebral transient ischemic attack. In conclusion "lone" AF has a favourable prognosis and systemic anticoagulation is not indicated, particularly in the absence of left atrial dilatation.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring usually is indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.


A 67-Year-Old Man With Palpitations During Sleep. A 67-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) presented to his physician with symptoms of episodic, nighttime palpitations and excessive daytime sleepiness. Four years prior he underwent radiofrequency ablation after a confirmed diagnosis of AF with subsequent resolution of his palpitations. His palpitations returned approximately 1 year following the ablation. These events would occur only at night and awake him from sleep. Holter monitoring showed baseline sinus rhythm with multiple episodes of AF with rates of 75 to 169 beats/min. These events were all nocturnal and correlated with the symptom diary; episodes ranged from 45Â min to 2 h. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and ejection fraction with a mildly enlarged right atrium (4.38Â cm) and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.


Limited clinical utility of Holter monitoring in patients with palpitations or altered consciousness: analysis of 8973 recordings in 7394 patients. To determine the clinical utility of 24 hour Holter monitoring by measuring the frequency of candidate arrhythmias recorded during the investigation of palpitations and altered consciousness. Of 9,729 Holter recordings, reports were available in 8,973 (92.2%) performed in the 7394 patients who comprise the study group. The mean age of the study group was 66 +/- 19 years and 56.4% were women. The most common indications were altered consciousness (41.7%) and palpitations (36.2%). Among patients with palpitations and sinus rhythm (n=2688), recordings were normal in 2247 (83.6%). Abnormalities included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF, 6.6%), narrow complex tachycardia (NCT, 2.8%) nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT/VT, 2.6%). Among patients with altered consciousness (n=3075), recordings were normal in 2589 (84.2%). Abnormalities included PAF (9.5%), NCT (2.6%), NSV/VT (0.2%), pause &gt;2.8s (2.2%) and high degree AV block (1.3%). The diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring was particularly low in patients aged &lt; or =50 years, of whom 93.1% had palpitations and 95.3% had altered consciousness had normal recordings. The diagnostic utility of Holter monitoring in patients being investigated for palpitations and altered consciousness is very limited, particularly in young patients for whom alternative diagnostic methods should be considered.




Question:
A 26-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodic palpitations for the past 2 months. He has the feeling that sometimes his heart “skips a beat”. His father has a history of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. He drinks 1–2 beers on the weekends. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a regular pulse. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies, including electrolytes and creatinine, are within normal limits. An excerpt of 24h Holter monitoring is shown. Echocardiography is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

[A] : Coronary angiography

Nerve injury following shoulder dislocation: the emergency physician's perspective. We describe the case of a 57-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with a right anterior shoulder dislocation following a fall onto the right shoulder and right upper arm. She also complained of numbness in the right forearm and dorsum of the right hand. The examination revealed a bruise to the upper aspect of the right arm resulting from the impact following the fall. The patient also had a right wrist drop and loss of sensation in the lateral border of the right forearm and on the dorsum of the right hand, suggesting a radial nerve injury. She also had altered sensation in the ulnar distribution of her right hand, suspicious of concomitant ulnar nerve injury. No loss of sensation in the distribution of the axillary nerve (regimental patch) was observed. These findings were carefully documented and the patient subsequently had the shoulder reduced under entonox and morphine. The neurological deficits remained unchanged. The patient was sent home from the emergency room with arrangements for orthopaedic and physiotherapy follow-up. After a 3-month period, she had clinical and electromyography evidence of persistent radial and ulnar nerve deficit. She continues to have physiotherapy. This case highlights the need for awareness of the potential for nerve damage following shoulder dislocation and also to ensure that appropriate follow-up plan is instituted on discharge from the emergency department.

An Unusual Case of Spontaneous Esophageal Rupture after Swallowing a Boneless Chicken Nugget. A 25-year-old previously healthy man presented to our Emergency Department with shortness of breath and epigastric pain after swallowing a boneless chicken nugget one hour prior to presentation. Physical examination revealed epigastric rigidity and tenderness. Serology was normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin and amylase. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a distal esophageal rupture with accompanying pneumomediastinum and left-sided pleural effusion. Treatment was initiated with administration of intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, an esophageal stent was inserted endoscopically in addition to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) drainage of the left-sided pleural space. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of Boerhaave's syndrome: a rare and life-threatening form of noniatrogenic esophageal rupture most often preceded by forceful vomiting. Our case demonstrates that physicians should maintain an index of suspicion for spontaneous esophageal rupture in patients presenting with shortness of breath and epigastric pain even in the absence of preceding vomiting, cough, or seizure. Additionally, ingestion of boneless, shell-less foods may be sufficient to cause rupture in individuals without underlying esophageal pathology. CT scan of the thorax and upper abdomen should be performed in these patients to rule out this rare and life-threatening diagnosis.

Cardiac diphtheria in a previously immunized individual. A previously healthy 19-year-old Asian female without significant past medical history presented to the emergency room complaining of a sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, fever, swollen neck, malaise, and myalgia for three to four days. The patient was initially seen at an outside hospital, evaluated by an ear, nose, and throat physician (ENT), and was found to have desquamative pharyngitis. The patient was transferred to our hospital after she continued to experience progressively worsening shortness of breath and went into acute respiratory distress. The patient was found to have laryngeal edema on exam with greenish-black, necrotic-looking tissue extending to the hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and oropharynx. A culture was taken. ENT was consulted for tracheostomy placement. The patient refused to have tracheostomy placed. She went into severe respiratory distress and required urgent tracheostomy. A cardiac consult was obtained. A 2D echocardiogram performed one day after admission revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-20%, normal left ventricular cavity size, normal wall thickness, and severe global systolic dysfunction. There was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. The inferior vena cava was dilated and a 1 cm x 1.5 cm questionable mass or thrombus was seen. The patient's throat culture was positive for diphtheria. The CDC was contacted, and the patient was treated with antitoxin with prompt resolution of cardiac symptoms. A repeat echo done five days post-treatment showed improved EF of 65%, normal left ventricular thickness and function, with no clot visualized. She was treated with ceftriaxone and flagyl for ocular motor neuritis, otitis media, and strep. pneumonia with gradual improvement. These were all secondary to the diphtheria toxins, however, the patient continues to be followed as an outpatient by ENT for ongoing problems with swallowing, speech, and trach management.

Context:
Clinical case of the month. A 29-year-old man with acute onset blurry vision, weakness, and gait abnormality. Stroke. A 29-year-old man, with no significant past medical history, was in his usual state of health until the afternoon of admission. The patient was seated at work eating lunch when he suddenly noticed that his vision became blurry. He covered his right eye and had no visual difficulty but noted blurry vision upon covering his left eye. At this point, the patient tried to stand up, but had difficulty walking and noticed he was "falling toward his left." Facial asymmetry when smiling was also appreciated. The patient denied any alteration in mental status, confusion, antecedent or current headaches, aura, chest pains, or shortness of breath. He was not taking any prescribed medications and had no known allergies. The patient denied any prior hospitalization or surgery. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and worked as a maintenance worker in a hotel. His family history is remarkable for his father who died of pancreatic cancer in his 50s and his mother who died of an unknown heart condition in her late 40s. Vital signs on presentation to the emergency department included temperature of 97.6 degrees F; respiratory rate of 18 per minute; pulse of 68 per minute; blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg; pulse oximetry of 99% on ambient air. His body mass index was 24 and he was complaining of no pain. The patient had no carotid bruits and no significant jugular venous distention. Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs. Neurological exam revealed left-sided facial weakness, dysarthria, and preserved visual fields. He was able to furrow his brow. Gait deviation to the left was present, and Romberg sign was negative. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout, and no other focal neurological deficit was present. The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of stroke. Electrocardiogram, fasting lipid profile, computed tomography (CT) scan of head, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head and neck, and transthoracic echo with bubble study were ordered. The initial head CT did not reveal bleeding. He was started on aspirin (ASA). On the second hospital day, the symptoms improved with resolution of dysarthria. His ataxia had also improved. Fasting lipid profile revealed mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol. His head MRI revealed an acute right thalamic stroke. Echocardiography was significant only for a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with transit of agitated saline "bubbles" from right atrium to left heart within three cardiac cycles (Figure). Doppler ultrasound of extremities revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. A complete resolution of symptoms occurred by the third hospital day. The patient was discharged on full dose aspirin and a statin and was referred for consideration of enrollment in a PFO closure versus medical management trial.

An Unusual Case of Spontaneous Esophageal Rupture after Swallowing a Boneless Chicken Nugget. A 25-year-old previously healthy man presented to our Emergency Department with shortness of breath and epigastric pain after swallowing a boneless chicken nugget one hour prior to presentation. Physical examination revealed epigastric rigidity and tenderness. Serology was normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin and amylase. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed a distal esophageal rupture with accompanying pneumomediastinum and left-sided pleural effusion. Treatment was initiated with administration of intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, an esophageal stent was inserted endoscopically in addition to VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) drainage of the left-sided pleural space. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of Boerhaave's syndrome: a rare and life-threatening form of noniatrogenic esophageal rupture most often preceded by forceful vomiting. Our case demonstrates that physicians should maintain an index of suspicion for spontaneous esophageal rupture in patients presenting with shortness of breath and epigastric pain even in the absence of preceding vomiting, cough, or seizure. Additionally, ingestion of boneless, shell-less foods may be sufficient to cause rupture in individuals without underlying esophageal pathology. CT scan of the thorax and upper abdomen should be performed in these patients to rule out this rare and life-threatening diagnosis.


Pain in abdomen and shoulder. A 26-year-old man came into the emergency department for treatment of vomiting, and pain in his abdomen and right shoulder. His vital signs were normal, with the exception of his heart rate, which was 109 bpm. His oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. The patient, a smoker, did not complain of any difficulty breathing, despite having diminished breath sounds over the left lung fields and absent breath sounds over the right. The rest of the exam was normal. The patient's initial blood work was within normal limits. We ordered a chest x-ray and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan to further assess his decreased breath sounds.

[Erythrocytosis in a 4 year-old child: diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutical problems]. Pure erythrocytosis is rare in children. This report describes such a case. A 4 year-old boy was admitted because erythrocytosis had been found routinely before adenoidectomy. He was born in Guatemala, was adopted just after his birth, and had been living in France since that age. Clinical examination was normal. His hemogram showed: erythrocytes: 8,800,000/mm3; hemoglobin: 20.1 g/dl; hematocrit: 66.8%; reticulocytes: 262,000/mm3; platelets: 200,000/mm3; leukocytes: 6,800/mm3. The patient had been given iron salts for the past 3 months without an earlier hemogram. Total red cell mass was 1200 ml (N: 600). The myelogram was normal as was the leukocyte alkaline phosphatases, serum lysozyme and vitamin B12. Blood ferritin was low (3.5 ng/ml). In vitro cultures of erythroid precursors were normal, as was the karyotype of myeloid cells. Blood erythropoietin concentration was 20-293 mU/ml (N:4-14). All the causes of secondary polycythemia were eliminated by appropriate investigations. The patient was treated by phlebotomy in aliquots of 25 ml/kg, twice a month, for 10 months, and was given iron therapy. At the end of treatment, his hemoglobin was 14 g/dl and his hematocrit was 45%. Both progressively increased again one year later, requiring new phlebotomies. The patient was followed for 4 years but no cause for this erythrocytosis was found; it was probably congenital in origin. This case of pure erythrocytosis was associated with elevated erythropoietin production. Whether this high secretion is related to receptor dysfunction remains to be determined.

Differential diagnostic and treatment difficulties in a patient with acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a rare, frequently underdiagnosed and underestimated bleeding disorder. Careful personal and family history and late-onset mucocutaneous bleeding could help clarify the etiology of bleeding deficiency. An 82-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic with a severe nosebleed on 30.05.2018. Laboratory results revealed thrombocytosis, elevated white blood cell count and high LDH. Basic coagulation parameters were normal. He was referred to our clinic, where a bone marrow biopsy was taken. His personal and family history had no mention of bleeding disorders, nor was he on anticoagulant therapy. We detected elevated VWF antigen and decreased VWF ristocetin cofactor activity. Loss of high molecular weight multimers was detected by using agarose gel electrophoresis. These laboratory results were indicative of AVWS. Hydroxyurea treatment was initiated, leading to a gradual decrease in platelet count. The histological examination revealed essential thrombocytosist while mutation analysis was JAK2/CALR/MPL negative. However, due to severe nosebleeds, the patient was hospitalized and needed blood transfusion. A cardiological check-up revealed the progression of aortic valve stenosis. After, balloon-dilation a transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed. As a result, VWF activity and activity to antigen ratio returned to normal as did multimeric structure. In July 2019, the follow-up examination showed that the patient was in a satisfactory condition, with normal hematological parameters, and no new nosebleed episode occurred. The patient complained of recurring nosebleeds, which stopped completely after the resolution of both underlying conditions successful cytoreductive treatment of triple-negative ET and transcatheteric aortic valve replacement.

A Case of Recurrent Thrombotic Microangiopathy Caused by Hypertensive Urgency. A 26-year-old man presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for four days. His medical history was significant for hypertension and end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis. He had been noncompliant with the antihypertensive regimen which included nifedipine, hydralazine, and spironolactone. At presentation, his blood pressure was 231/123 mmHg. Laboratory workup showed white blood count 17.3 Ã 109/L (normal range: 4.5 to 11.0 Ã 109/L), hemoglobin 7.8 gm/dL (normal range: 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL), platelet count 46 Ã 109/L (normal range: 150 to 400 Ã 109/L), reticulocyte count 7.8%, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 1,235 U/L (normal range: 140 to 280 U/L), haptoglobin &lt; 10 mg/dL, and a direct Coomb's test was negative. Numerous schistocytes were identified on the peripheral blood smear. The patient was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to severe hypertension and was started on intravenous nicardipine. With appropriate blood pressure control, hematological parameters improved with normalization of the platelet count within 10 days. Notably, the patient had one similar episode of hypertension-induced thrombotic microangiopathy within a period of the last three months and ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifÂ 13) activity was normal on his previous admission.

Disseminated histoplasmosis presenting as pyoderma gangrenosum-like lesions in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A 33-year-old Hispanic woman with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 2, viral load of 730,000 copies/mL, candidal esophagitis, seizure disorder, a history of bacterial pneumonia, and recent weight loss was admitted with tonic clonic seizure. On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis.

Social Determinants of Health and the Role of Routine Pediatric Care in a Medically Complex Toddler. Late on a Friday afternoon, a new family presents to your practice for urgent care. They come with their youngest child Mai, a 2-year-old girl, who, although born in the United States at 36 weeks gestation, has resided in Laos with her grandparents for the past 16 months. Your triage nurse tells you that she has a fever and was found to have profound anemia while at the WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) office earlier today.On walking into the room, you describe Mai as "listless" and "sickly." Her vitals were notable for fever (102Â°F), tachycardia (140 beats per minute), and tachypnea (35 breaths per minute). On physical examination, she was grunting with a systolic ejection murmur and without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory test results revealed hemoglobin of 2.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 12%, mean corpuscular volume of 50 fL, red cell distribution width of 27%, reticulocyte count of 3%, ferritin of &lt;2 ng/mL, iron of 15 Î¼g/dL, total iron binding count of 420 Î¼g/dL, white blood cell count of 13.5 K/Î¼L, and platelets of 605 K/Î¼L. Her evaluation was consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA), which was further supported by reported restrictive diet and excessive cow milk intake of 35 ounces daily. She was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in high-output cardiac failure and was slowly transfused with 15 mL/kg of packed red blood cells over 2 days with careful monitoring. Once stabilized, she was transferred to the inpatient floor for further nutritional evaluation and supplementation. Additional workup, including hemoglobin electrophoresis, fecal occult blood test, celiac studies, and stool parasite testing were normal. The clinical picture was consistent with a viral infection in the setting of profound IDA and malnutrition.Although her clinical status had improved, she remained inpatient for nutritional optimization. Her height was at the 54th percentile (z-score: 0.11), weight was at the first percentile (z-score: -2.25), and body mass index was below the first percentile (z-score: -3.18), diagnostic of severe protein-calorie malnutrition. She was evaluated by an interdisciplinary growth and nutrition team, received multivitamin and mineral supplements, and was monitored for refeeding syndrome. She was noted to be "difficult to engage," "resistant to new faces," and made little progress on expanding her dietary choices. Concerns about a possible diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder were raised by her treating team. What would you do next? 1. Bouma S.

A four-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother for recurrent nosebleeds. The mother reports that the boy has had five nosebleeds within the past 2 weeks, each lasting between 15 and 20 minutes. The patient was born at term and has been hospitalized twice for pneumonia treatment. There is no family history of serious illness. The patient is at the 8th percentile for height and the 30th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a small, thin child with two flat, dark brown areas of hyperpigmentation across the upper back and a similar discoloration on the left buttock. There is bilateral esotropia. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 107 μm3, leukocyte count of 3,800/mm3, and platelet count of 46,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

[A] : Defect in DNA crosslink repair
[B] : Mutation in WAS protein
[C] : Recent history of NSAID use
[D] : Postviral autoimmune reaction

[Erythrocytosis in a 4 year-old child: diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutical problems]. Pure erythrocytosis is rare in children. This report describes such a case. A 4 year-old boy was admitted because erythrocytosis had been found routinely before adenoidectomy. He was born in Guatemala, was adopted just after his birth, and had been living in France since that age. Clinical examination was normal. His hemogram showed: erythrocytes: 8,800,000/mm3; hemoglobin: 20.1 g/dl; hematocrit: 66.8%; reticulocytes: 262,000/mm3; platelets: 200,000/mm3; leukocytes: 6,800/mm3. The patient had been given iron salts for the past 3 months without an earlier hemogram. Total red cell mass was 1200 ml (N: 600). The myelogram was normal as was the leukocyte alkaline phosphatases, serum lysozyme and vitamin B12. Blood ferritin was low (3.5 ng/ml). In vitro cultures of erythroid precursors were normal, as was the karyotype of myeloid cells. Blood erythropoietin concentration was 20-293 mU/ml (N:4-14). All the causes of secondary polycythemia were eliminated by appropriate investigations. The patient was treated by phlebotomy in aliquots of 25 ml/kg, twice a month, for 10 months, and was given iron therapy. At the end of treatment, his hemoglobin was 14 g/dl and his hematocrit was 45%. Both progressively increased again one year later, requiring new phlebotomies. The patient was followed for 4 years but no cause for this erythrocytosis was found; it was probably congenital in origin. This case of pure erythrocytosis was associated with elevated erythropoietin production. Whether this high secretion is related to receptor dysfunction remains to be determined.


Differential diagnostic and treatment difficulties in a patient with acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a rare, frequently underdiagnosed and underestimated bleeding disorder. Careful personal and family history and late-onset mucocutaneous bleeding could help clarify the etiology of bleeding deficiency. An 82-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic with a severe nosebleed on 30.05.2018. Laboratory results revealed thrombocytosis, elevated white blood cell count and high LDH. Basic coagulation parameters were normal. He was referred to our clinic, where a bone marrow biopsy was taken. His personal and family history had no mention of bleeding disorders, nor was he on anticoagulant therapy. We detected elevated VWF antigen and decreased VWF ristocetin cofactor activity. Loss of high molecular weight multimers was detected by using agarose gel electrophoresis. These laboratory results were indicative of AVWS. Hydroxyurea treatment was initiated, leading to a gradual decrease in platelet count. The histological examination revealed essential thrombocytosist while mutation analysis was JAK2/CALR/MPL negative. However, due to severe nosebleeds, the patient was hospitalized and needed blood transfusion. A cardiological check-up revealed the progression of aortic valve stenosis. After, balloon-dilation a transcatheter aortic valve implantation was performed. As a result, VWF activity and activity to antigen ratio returned to normal as did multimeric structure. In July 2019, the follow-up examination showed that the patient was in a satisfactory condition, with normal hematological parameters, and no new nosebleed episode occurred. The patient complained of recurring nosebleeds, which stopped completely after the resolution of both underlying conditions successful cytoreductive treatment of triple-negative ET and transcatheteric aortic valve replacement.

A Case of Recurrent Thrombotic Microangiopathy Caused by Hypertensive Urgency. A 26-year-old man presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for four days. His medical history was significant for hypertension and end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis. He had been noncompliant with the antihypertensive regimen which included nifedipine, hydralazine, and spironolactone. At presentation, his blood pressure was 231/123 mmHg. Laboratory workup showed white blood count 17.3 Ã 109/L (normal range: 4.5 to 11.0 Ã 109/L), hemoglobin 7.8 gm/dL (normal range: 13.5 to 17.5 g/dL), platelet count 46 Ã 109/L (normal range: 150 to 400 Ã 109/L), reticulocyte count 7.8%, total bilirubin 1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase 1,235 U/L (normal range: 140 to 280 U/L), haptoglobin &lt; 10 mg/dL, and a direct Coomb's test was negative. Numerous schistocytes were identified on the peripheral blood smear. The patient was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to severe hypertension and was started on intravenous nicardipine. With appropriate blood pressure control, hematological parameters improved with normalization of the platelet count within 10 days. Notably, the patient had one similar episode of hypertension-induced thrombotic microangiopathy within a period of the last three months and ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motifÂ 13) activity was normal on his previous admission.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke. A 49 year-old man with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement in the right coronary artery in 2010 presented for evaluation of left hemiplegia. He was feeling well until three hours prior to presentation, at which time he fell while walking from his bedroom into the kitchen. After falling, he noticed that his left upper and lower extremities felt weak. He denied any symptoms preceding the fall or any loss of consciousness. On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

[A 66-year-old man with backache and progressive difficulty of gait]. We report a 66-year-old man with progressive spinal paraplegia. He was well until June of 1991 when he had an onset of backache and right chest pain. On August 25, he lost sensation to void and he became unable to urinate. On the same day, he noted weakness in his legs which became progressively worse, and he was admitted to our hospital. Past medical history included diabetes mellitus which was found 3 years previously. He had upper gastrointestinal series 2 months before, which revealed a normal study. On admission, he was alert and general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a mentally sound man with normal higher cerebral functions. Cranial nerves were also intact. He was unable to walk. No muscle atrophy was noted, but he had moderate to marked (2/5) weakness in both legs. No ataxia was noted in the upper extremities. Jaw jerk was normal, however, deep reflexes in the upper extremities were decreased, and absent in the lower extremities Babinski sign was present bilaterally. All sensory modalities were diminished below the Th 6 dermatome. No meningeal sign was present. Emergency myelography was performed on the day of admission, which revealed complete block from the Th4 to Th8 segments. CSF taken at that time was xanthochromic, positive Queckenstedt test containing 1,133 mg/dl of protein, 54 mg/dl of sugar and 1/3 microliters of lymphocyte. On August 31, laminectomy was performed from Th5 to Th7. The spinal bones in this area was very fragile and hemorrhagic. A soft yellowish vascular-rich tissue was surrounding the spinal cord in the epidural space. Despite surgery his weakness in legs worsened, and he became paraplegic by September 10th. He became somnolent with disorientation to time. In the subsequent course, he developed metabolic acidosis on September 26. On September 28, he became anuric and hypotensive. He expired later on that day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

An unusual presentation of Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome in a young man with bilateral upper extremity weakness. A 30-year-old man attended the emergency department with a 4-day history of progressive, bilateral upper limb weakness. He had mild shortness of breath and occasional swallowing difficulties. One month prior to presentation, he had flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea. Examination revealed upper limb hypotonia, symmetrical distal arm weakness and hyporeflexia. Power and reflexes in the lower limbs were normal. Nerve conduction studies and lumbar puncture demonstrated features consistent with Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS). The patient was treated with a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulins. He improved significantly over the next 2âweeks. Breathing and swallow function did not deteriorate and required no further intervention. He had a sustained improvement, and remained at baseline 1âyear later. Work-up for underlying structural, infectious, inflammatory and paraneoplastic aetiologies were negative. Serum antiganglioside antibodies were positive for the anti-GT1a IgG isotype supporting the clinical diagnosis of the pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS.

His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.


Acute chest pain in an elderly woman. A 79-year-old woman was admitted to hospital complaining of chest pain, increasing weakness, anorexia, hoarseness, headache and discomfort in the throat and jaws while eating. Physical examination, chest x-rays, serial electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. After admission she developed weakness and numbness in the left leg with urinary retention, decreased sensation to touch, weakness, increased tone, absent deep tendon reflexes and a positive Babinski sign on the left. Zeta sedimentation rate was markedly elevated at 0.63. Computerized tomographic head scan, myelography, echocardiography, barium swallow and meal, immunoglobulins, electrophoresis and other laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Repeat sedimentation rate was still markedly elevated three weeks later. A temporal artery biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of temporal or giant cell arteritis. Prednisone, 60 mg daily, was started.

[A 66-year-old man with backache and progressive difficulty of gait]. We report a 66-year-old man with progressive spinal paraplegia. He was well until June of 1991 when he had an onset of backache and right chest pain. On August 25, he lost sensation to void and he became unable to urinate. On the same day, he noted weakness in his legs which became progressively worse, and he was admitted to our hospital. Past medical history included diabetes mellitus which was found 3 years previously. He had upper gastrointestinal series 2 months before, which revealed a normal study. On admission, he was alert and general physical examination was unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed a mentally sound man with normal higher cerebral functions. Cranial nerves were also intact. He was unable to walk. No muscle atrophy was noted, but he had moderate to marked (2/5) weakness in both legs. No ataxia was noted in the upper extremities. Jaw jerk was normal, however, deep reflexes in the upper extremities were decreased, and absent in the lower extremities Babinski sign was present bilaterally. All sensory modalities were diminished below the Th 6 dermatome. No meningeal sign was present. Emergency myelography was performed on the day of admission, which revealed complete block from the Th4 to Th8 segments. CSF taken at that time was xanthochromic, positive Queckenstedt test containing 1,133 mg/dl of protein, 54 mg/dl of sugar and 1/3 microliters of lymphocyte. On August 31, laminectomy was performed from Th5 to Th7. The spinal bones in this area was very fragile and hemorrhagic. A soft yellowish vascular-rich tissue was surrounding the spinal cord in the epidural space. Despite surgery his weakness in legs worsened, and he became paraplegic by September 10th. He became somnolent with disorientation to time. In the subsequent course, he developed metabolic acidosis on September 26. On September 28, he became anuric and hypotensive. He expired later on that day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

The variable influence of lifestyle and income on medical students' career specialty choices: data from two U.S. medical schools, 1998-2004. Recent reports on medical students' career choices suggest that lifestyle increasingly influences career decisions. The authors addressed the changing influence of lifestyle and income on career choice, how these influences differ by specialty, and the specific careers students identify as lifestyle friendly. From 1998 to 2004, 1,334 (73%) fourth-year medical students from Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University (no. = 485 graduates) and New York Medical College (no. = 1,348 graduates) completed a questionnaire that addressed career specialty preferences, as well as income and lifestyle concerns. Students were asked to rate career choice influences on a four-point scale (1 = no influence, 4 = major influence). Factor analysis of these influences identified seven factors including one each for lifestyle and income. A total of 1,327 students indicated a career preference. Lifestyle (p = .018) and income (p = .011) were found to increasingly influence medical students' career choices during the study period. Overall, the authors found significant differences between specialties in the relative contribution of these factors. Students' perceptions of specialties existed on a continuum of lifestyle friendly (e.g., radiology) to lifestyle unfriendly (e.g., obstetrics-gynecology). Contrary to previous reports, the students' responses indicate they perceived the primary care specialties as lifestyle intermediate compared to other specialties. Lifestyle and income have become more important to medical students in their career choice, and the relative influence of these factors varies considerably between specialties. This study suggests that previous efforts to dichotomize careers into those with controllable and uncontrollable lifestyles may mask important complexities.

Match rates into higher-income, controllable lifestyle specialties for students from highly ranked, research-based medical schools compared with other applicants. Factors impacting medical student specialty career choice are poorly understood, but may include income potential and lifestyle features such as limited and predictable work hours. Data from the National Resident Matching Program and the San Francisco Match were used to examine match rates into higher-income controllable lifestyle (CL), lower-income CL, and noncontrollable lifestyle (NCL) specialties from 2002 to 2007. We studied 3 cohorts: students from highly ranked, research-based medical schools, other US senior medical students, and independent applicants (consisting mostly of graduates from foreign medical schools). By 2007, 22.5% of students from highly ranked schools matched into a higher-income CL specialty compared with 16.5% of other US seniors and 8.4% of independent applicants. During the study period, students from highly ranked schools increased their match rate in higher-income CL specialties by 7.9%, while all cohorts experienced declines in match rates for NCL specialties. Compared with other US seniors, students from highly ranked schools were more likely to match into higher-income CL specialties (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-1.68), while independent applicants were much less likely to do so (OR, 0.46; 95% CI: 0.42-0.51). Independent applicants had the highest odds (OR, 2.38; 95% CI: 2.25-2.52) of matching into NCL specialties. All cohorts had declining match rates into NCL specialties from 2002 to 2007. When compared with other US seniors, students from highly ranked schools had the highest odds of matching in higher-income CL specialties, while independent applicants had the highest odds of matching into NCL specialties. These trends are important to consider in light of recent efforts to better balance the physician workforce.

Quantifying the Financial Value of Clinical Specialty Choice and Its Association With Competitiveness of Admissions. Background The factors influencing medical student clinical specialty choice have important implications for the future composition of the US physician workforce. The objective of this study was to determine the career net present values (NPVs) of US medical students' clinical specialty choices and identify any relationships between a specialty's NPV and competitiveness of admissions as measured by the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores. Methodology NPVs were calculated using the results of the 2019 Doximity Physician Compensation report, a survey of 90,000 physicians. Mean USMLE Step 1 scores for matched US allopathic seniors in the 2018 National Resident Matching Program were used as a measure of clinical specialties' competitiveness of admissions. We calculated a composite measure of NPV and annual work-hours by dividing each specialty's NPV by the reported average number of hours worked per year. Results In our analysis, orthopedic surgery had the highest NPV ($10,308,868), whereas family medicine had the lowest NPV ($5,274,546). Dermatology and plastic surgery had the highest mean USMLE Step 1 scores (249 for both), whereas family medicine had the lowest (220). Clinical specialties' NPVs were positively associated with mean USMLE Step 1 scores (Pearson's r = 0.82; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions In this study, we describe associations suggesting thatÂ medical students respond to financial incentives in choosing clinical specialties and that these decisions are mediated by USMLE Step 1 scores. This underscores the importance of titrating and aligning incentives to improve the allocation of medical students into clinical specialties.

Factors influencing Saudi medical students and interns' choice of future specialty: a self-administered questionnaire. This study explores the most influential factors affecting Saudi medical students and interns' choice of specialty at the University of Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed during the period from June 1 to June 14, 2013. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to test the association between participants' choices and the motivational factors that led to their choice of specialty. One-hundred sixty-eight (44.7%) participants chose lifestyle as their most influential factor for the choice of their specialty. Significantly more medical interns considered lifestyle as an important factor compared to medical students (P=0.020). Internal medicine was the preferred specialty for 56 participants (14.77%) followed by family medicine for 35 participants (9.2%). Thirty-four participants (8.97%) chose general surgery, and 27 participants (7.1%) chose both pediatrics and emergency medicine. Sex influences indicated that men preferred pediatrics and emergency medicine (P=0.033 and P=0.0006, respectively), while women preferred family medicine practice (P=0.034). Saudi medical students and interns at the University of Dammam were influenced mostly by lifestyle when they considered their future specialty. Internal medicine, family medicine, general surgery, pediatrics, and emergency medicine were the preferred specialties.

[The effect of some factors on medical student specialty choice of non-primary care--a synthesis of the literature]. The paper analyses the literature on non-primary care specialty choice. The motives for studying medicine and influences on medical student career choice have been presented. The stability of this selection has also been examined. Several predictors of specialty choice such as: demographics, academic performance, income, social status and personality attributes have been identified. Moreover, the influence of prestige, intellectual content, ability to provide sophisticated technology on preferences of non-primary care specialty has been analyzed. Association between empathy and medical specialty choice has been evaluated. What is more, it is presented that internal medicine residents are more likely to be introverted, attentive, to have deeper intellectual curiosity, higher aspiration levels and to be interested in mental stimulations. Furthermore, the surgery residents are more likely to be interested in modern technology, prestige, higher income and to be assertive and extroversive. In addition, students attracted to gynecology like contact with (mostly healthy) patients and express strong believes on reproductive issues. Besides, psychiatry students seem to be sensitive, unstable and impulsive. The analyses of Polish students' attitudes to non-primary care specialties are also presented. There is a positive perception of non-primary care and hospital medicine specialties. The specialties are more attractive because of foreseeable higher income, prestige, opportunities for research and possibilities for mastering skills and knowledge.

By 2007, 22.5% of students from highly ranked schools matched into a higher-income CL specialty compared with 16.5% of other US seniors and 8.4% of independent applicants. During the study period, students from highly ranked schools increased their match rate in higher-income CL specialties by 7.9%, while all cohorts experienced declines in match rates for NCL specialties. Compared with other US seniors, students from highly ranked schools were more likely to match into higher-income CL specialties (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-1.68), while independent applicants were much less likely to do so (OR, 0.46; 95% CI: 0.42-0.51). Independent applicants had the highest odds (OR, 2.38; 95% CI: 2.25-2.52) of matching into NCL specialties. All cohorts had declining match rates into NCL specialties from 2002 to 2007. When compared with other US seniors, students from highly ranked schools had the highest odds of matching in higher-income CL specialties, while independent applicants had the highest odds of matching into NCL specialties. These trends are important to consider in light of recent efforts to better balance the physician workforce.


Quantifying the Financial Value of Clinical Specialty Choice and Its Association With Competitiveness of Admissions. Background The factors influencing medical student clinical specialty choice have important implications for the future composition of the US physician workforce. The objective of this study was to determine the career net present values (NPVs) of US medical students' clinical specialty choices and identify any relationships between a specialty's NPV and competitiveness of admissions as measured by the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores. Methodology NPVs were calculated using the results of the 2019 Doximity Physician Compensation report, a survey of 90,000 physicians. Mean USMLE Step 1 scores for matched US allopathic seniors in the 2018 National Resident Matching Program were used as a measure of clinical specialties' competitiveness of admissions. We calculated a composite measure of NPV and annual work-hours by dividing each specialty's NPV by the reported average number of hours worked per year. Results In our analysis, orthopedic surgery had the highest NPV ($10,308,868), whereas family medicine had the lowest NPV ($5,274,546). Dermatology and plastic surgery had the highest mean USMLE Step 1 scores (249 for both), whereas family medicine had the lowest (220). Clinical specialties' NPVs were positively associated with mean USMLE Step 1 scores (Pearson's r = 0.82; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions In this study, we describe associations suggesting thatÂ medical students respond to financial incentives in choosing clinical specialties and that these decisions are mediated by USMLE Step 1 scores. This underscores the importance of titrating and aligning incentives to improve the allocation of medical students into clinical specialties.

Origin of superior thyroid artery: under the surgeon's knife. The major arterial supply to the thyroid gland is from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, arising from the external carotid artery and the thyrocervical trunk respectively. The external laryngeal nerve runs in close proximity to the origin of the superior thyroid artery in relation to the thyroid gland. The superior thyroid artery is clinically important in head and neck surgeries. To locate the origin of the superior thyroid artery, because wide variability is reported. To provide knowledge of possible variations in its origin, because it is important for surgical procedures in the neck. The origin of the superior thyroid artery was studied by dissecting sixty adult human hemineck specimens from donated cadavers in a Department of Anatomy. The highest incidence observed was origin of the superior thyroid artery from the external carotid artery (88.33%), whereas origin from the common carotid bifurcation only occurred in 8.33%. However, in 3.33% of cases, the superior thyroid artery originated from the common carotid artery and in a single case, the external laryngeal nerve did not cross the stem of the superior thyroid artery at all, but ran ventral and parallel to the artery. It is important to rule out anomalous origin of superior thyroid artery and verify its relationship to the external laryngeal nerve prior to ligation of the artery in thyroid surgeries, in order to prevent iatrogenic injuries. Moreover, because anomalous origins of the superior thyroid artery are only anatomic variants, thorough knowledge of these is decisive for head and neck surgeries.

Right nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve deforming a superior parathyroid adenoma: report of a case. A 34-year-old patient with primary hyperparathyroidism and repeated renal stones underwent a parathyroidectomy. During operation, a right superior parathyroid adenoma was found which measured 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.0cm in size. The right nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve passed over the middle of the adenoma, and deformed the parathyroid into a dumbbell shape. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed an absence of the right innominate artery and an independent origin of the right retroesophageal subclavian and common carotid artery. The combination of the parathyroid tumor and nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve is extremely rare, especially in Asia. To avoid surgical complications, it is important to understand the possibility of a nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve developing in such patients.

Unusual external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve: a case report. The knowledge of the branching pattern of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and its relationship with the superior thyroid artery is the key point for identifying the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve during surgeries of the neck. During routine dissection of the left head and neck region of a 50 years old female cadaver, we observed a variation of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve around the superior thyroid artery. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve has presented one medial and three lateral branches. The medial branch was running on the surface of the inferior constrictor and pierced it; where as the lateral three branches are located laterally to the superior thyroid artery. The medial two lateral branches were piercing the substance of the thyroid gland, where as the lateral most branch was communicating with the left sympathetic chain. It is very important that surgeons carefully dissect the region of the superior pole of the thyroid gland to expose the abnormal branching pattern of external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve prior to ligation of individual thyroid vessels.

Perforation of superior thyroid artery by guidewire during carotid artery stenting. Although carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become a common treatment for carotid artery stenosis, some complications occur related to the procedures. Perforation of an external carotid artery (ECA) branch is a rare complication. An 83-year-old man presented with gait disturbance and dysarthria. MRI demonstrated a fresh cerebral infarction in the watershed territory of the left cerebrum and severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery (ICA). He underwent CAS for the left ICA stenosis. After the procedure, the patient complained of discomfort of the throat. Swelling of the neck was observed and angiography showed extravasation of contrast medium from the superior thyroid artery. The patient was immediately sedated and intubated. Strict control of the blood pressure was continued. Two days after CAS, the tracheal tube was extracted. He was discharged without deficit on the 17th post-stenting day. Injury of ECA branches is a potential complication when a guidewire is inserted during advancement of the materials. It may be life threatening due to associated respiratory problems. Once bleeding from the ECA is suspected, close observation of the patient's neck and respiration and immediate intervention are necessary.

Surgical anatomy of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and its clinical significance in head and neck surgery. Injury of the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) increases the morbidity following a variety of neck procedures and can have catastrophic consequences in people who use their voice professionally. Identification and preservation of the EBSLN are thus important in thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, carotid endarterectomy, and anterior cervical spine procedures, where the nerve is at risk. There are large variations in the anatomical course of the EBSLN, which makes the intraoperative identification of the nerve challenging. The topographic relationship of the EBSLN to the superior thyroid artery and the upper pole of the thyroid gland are considered by many authors to be the key point for identifying the nerve during surgery of the neck. The classifications by Cernea et al. ([1992a] Head Neck 14:380-383; [1992b] Am. J. Surg. 164:634-639) and by Kierner et al. ([1998] Arch. Otolaryngol. Head Neck Surg. 124:301-303), as well as clinically important connections are discussed in detail. Along with sound anatomical knowledge, neuromonitoring is helpful in identifying the EBSLN during neck procedures. The clinical signs of EBSLN injury include hoarseness, decreased voice projection, decreased pitch range, and fatigue after extensive voice use. Videostroboscopy, electromyography, voice analysis, and electroglottography can provide crucial information on the function of the EBSLN following neck surgery.

[Fulminant, life-threatening influenza A/H1N1 virus infection]. A 52-year-old man presented with unproductive cough, fever and chill in our emergency department. Self-medication with amoxicillin over 3 days failed to improve his condition. The patient was in poor general condition. His body temperature was 38.4 C, with a heart rate of 124/min, a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and a positive shock index. At auscultation of the chest fine rales were heard over both lungs with diminished percussion sounds basal. The respiratory rate was 30/min and the oxygen saturation of 84% at room air. Laboratory: signs of inflammation; blood gas analysis: pronounced hypoxemia. A chest radiogram revealed signs of extensive pulmonary infiltrates on both sides. The patient was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit. He received piperacillin, sulbactam and levoflaxacin, ample fluid and non-invasive ventilation as well as intermittent catecholamine treatment. As there was no clinical improvement the patient was intubated on day 3. On bronchoscopy viral etiology was suspected. At this time the respiratory situation deteriorated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed. An antifungal and antiviral treatment (voriconazol, oseltamivir) was started and a cortisone pulse was attempted. The patient was transferred to another clinic where extracorporeal membranoxygenation (ECMO) was performed on the same day. The following day influenza A/H1N1-test was confirmed. Ten days after transfer, the patient regained spontaneous respiration, and he most likely survives the infection. The incidence of influenza (A/H1N1) has increased in Germany and severe and lethal courses have occurred. Therefore, the diagnostic and treatment algorithms need to be reconsidered in order to rapidly diagnose and treat infections.

A 32-Year-Old Man With Dyspnea and Stridor. A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of dyspnea on exertion for 2Â months. Dyspnea occurred in both inspiration and expiration with an associated wheeze that was more pronounced with exertion. He had no other medical history or allergies. The patient was a current one-pack-a-day smoker for the past 5 years. He denied any close personal contact or recent exposure to any patients with active TB. He denied any current symptoms of chest pain, cough, fever, or changes in weight. On a prior admission for similar symptoms, the patient had been diagnosed with asthma and treated with an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist with no change or improvement in symptoms.

Diagnosis of EVALI: General Approach and the Role of Bronchoscopy. A 23-year-old man arrives at the ED with a 3-week history of dyspnea, dry cough, fevers, and night sweats. Two weeks previously, he was evaluated in an outpatient clinic and given a course of azithromycin for presumed infectious pneumonia. His symptoms did not improve, and he was seen 1Â week later in an urgent care center and given a prescription for doxycycline, which he has been taking without improvement. He states that he feels miserable, has severe nausea and vomiting, and has not eaten in several days. His only medical history is childhood asthma. He reports no surgeries and takes no medications. He has no risk factors for HIV, does not smoke combustible cigarettes or use IV drugs, and has not recently traveled. Examination shows a room air saturation of 89%, a temperature of 38.3Â°C, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. Results of his examination are normal, and there are no rales or wheezing heard in the lungs. Chest radiograph shows bilateral, consolidative opacities. WBC count is 14,000, with left shift. Results of biochemistries are normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 104, and procalcitonin is 0.08. Urine toxicology screen is positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Asked specifically about vaping and e-cigarette use, he reports that he recently began using THC "carts" that his friend gets from an unknown supplier. What is the diagnosis and what additional steps are necessary to confirm it? Is bronchoscopy indicated?


A 31-Year-Old Pregnant Woman With Asthma, Presenting With Worsening Dyspnea, Wheeze, and Hoarseness. A 31-year-old woman (gravida 3 and para 1-0-1-1 at 20Â weeks gestation) was admitted to the hospital for a presumed acute asthma exacerbation. She had a history of severe persistent asthma since childhood. She described her symptoms as progressively worsening since the beginning of her pregnancy. In addition to her dyspnea and wheeze, both of which occurred at rest and with exertion, she complained of worsening hoarseness and mild dysphagia of solid foods over the week before admission. Her primary care provider treated her with a combined corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist inhaler, albuterol inhaler and nebulizer, azithromycin, and two courses of prednisone without improvement. Her allergist performed a handheld spirometry 2Â months before admission that was repeated 3Â weeks later in the office. She had a social history of alcohol dependence but had been sober for 9Â months. She was a former one-pack-per-day smoker but quit 20Â weeks before admission and used marijuana occasionally. She had no known occupational or inhalation exposures.

Care under the Influence. A forty-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife at five in the morning, two hours after he fell down the stairs at home, hitting his head and injuring his arm. He tells the ER physician that he got up to get a drink of water and tripped in the dark. His speech is slurred, and he smells strongly of alcohol. Lab results reveal elevated liver enzymes, and his blood alcohol level is 0.1. His medical history is unremarkable. When asked about his alcohol consumption, he says he usually has one or two drinks a night with dinner but that he drinks more on holidays and special occasions. He admits he had more to drink than usual last night because it had been a stressful day at work, but he is vague about how much he drank. His wife takes the ER physician aside and describes a very different situation. She says that her husband regularly has three or four drinks a night. She always goes to bed before he does and thinks he stays up later so he can continue to drink. She says that he often has no memory of conversations they had the night before and is concerned because he makes work-related calls at night. When asked what he does for a living, she hesitates, and then answers that he is an internist. He does not work at this hospital but works at one of its affiliated clinics. The ER doctor is concerned that his patient is an impaired physician. Yet when the admitting hospitalist, to whom he explains the situation, asks if he really wants to "go there," he shrugs his shoulders. "I suppose," she replies, "you might as well call an ethics consult."

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

A dominating imaginary friend, cruelty to animals, social withdrawal, and growth deficiency in a 7-year-old girl with parents with schizophrenia. Tessa is a 7-year-old girl with odd behaviors, worsening over the preceding year. She spends a significant amount of time alone in her room, talking to "Richard." Her father observed that Tessa is "in her own world." In school, she often glares at the teacher and refuses to work. She is alone at recess without any real friends. Her father reports that she eats little and only after he tastes the food. She is increasingly cruel to both real and toy animals. She tied a string around her cat's neck and swung it around, saying she wanted to punish it. She was heard to say to her stuffed cat, "Die, b ... .; die." Richard told her to do this and other "bad" things. Tessa has not had chronic health problems or developmental concerns. During the first 18 months of life, her height was between the 5th and 10th percentiles; it declined to below the 3rd percentile over the past 2 years. Weight has been consistently between the 3rd and 5th percentiles. Tessa's parents both have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. There are at least 7 first- and second-degree relatives with the same diagnosis. Both parents cared for Tessa for 4 years with a lot of support. Then, her father left the home, but he was in contact with her while managing his own illness. When the mother's illness and compliance worsened, Tessa was removed for neglect at 5 (1/2) years old. Two foster homes preceded Dad's award of sole custody 13 months ago. Mother's weekly visitations are quite upsetting to Tessa. Tessa is a verbal, solemn, small, well-dressed girl with no physical abnormalities. She talks with advanced vocabulary and syntax, with normal prosody and good conversational skills. She says Richard is a bad boy who gets her into trouble at school. She equivocates when asked if he is real or imagined or if others can see him. She says that she misses her mother.

Manipulative and antisocial behavior in an 11-year-old boy with epilepsy. Brian is an 11-year-old boy who presented to the emergency room with suicidal ideation and hearing voices. In the preceding weeks, he had escalating symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and bipolar disorder. His medical history was notable for complex partial epilepsy with onset at age 4 that had been well controlled with divalproate. He had several mental health diagnoses by various practitioners including oppositional defiant disorder, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. Brian's family and social history was notable for the absence of identifiable risk factors for seizures or psychiatric problems. Over the course of a week-long psychiatric hospitalization, his complaints of depression and hearing voices seemed incongruent with his behavior. His parents endorsed a long history of Brian manipulating family and friends, such as conning his friends into stealing money and giving it to him. There was increasing suspicion that Brian was contriving his presenting symptoms for secondary gains. When his parents visited, he consistently bargained for prized items such as a long sought after cell phone and his own bedroom to improve his mood. His prior diagnoses (ADHD, a mood disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder) did not capture what seemed to be his core problem--an ability and willingness to manipulate others for his own self-serving purposes. Three months later, he was seen in the pediatric neurology clinic for increased seizure frequency. In the interim, he had several very serious altercations including setting fire to his family church, an attempted break-in-and-entry, assaulting his principal and resisting the arresting officer, and a malicious planned attack on his father where he struck him in the head with a crescent wrench "in cold blood, without any emotion."

Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. A 19-year-old man is brought to his primary physician by his father, who explains that his son washes his hands a hundred times a day, will not touch anything that has been touched by someone else without scrubbing it first, and has a fear of germs that has left him isolated in his bedroom, unable to eat, and wishing he were dead. Although the father reports that his son has always been finicky, this problem started approximately 2 years ago and has gradually become completely disabling. How should this patient be evaluated and treated?


Care under the Influence. A forty-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife at five in the morning, two hours after he fell down the stairs at home, hitting his head and injuring his arm. He tells the ER physician that he got up to get a drink of water and tripped in the dark. His speech is slurred, and he smells strongly of alcohol. Lab results reveal elevated liver enzymes, and his blood alcohol level is 0.1. His medical history is unremarkable. When asked about his alcohol consumption, he says he usually has one or two drinks a night with dinner but that he drinks more on holidays and special occasions. He admits he had more to drink than usual last night because it had been a stressful day at work, but he is vague about how much he drank. His wife takes the ER physician aside and describes a very different situation. She says that her husband regularly has three or four drinks a night. She always goes to bed before he does and thinks he stays up later so he can continue to drink. She says that he often has no memory of conversations they had the night before and is concerned because he makes work-related calls at night. When asked what he does for a living, she hesitates, and then answers that he is an internist. He does not work at this hospital but works at one of its affiliated clinics. The ER doctor is concerned that his patient is an impaired physician. Yet when the admitting hospitalist, to whom he explains the situation, asks if he really wants to "go there," he shrugs his shoulders. "I suppose," she replies, "you might as well call an ethics consult."

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

Question:
A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician's office by his parents for a scheduled visit. His father tells the physician that he has observed, on several occasions, that his son has difficulty breathing. This is more prominent when he is outside playing with his friends. These symptoms are increased during the spring and winter seasons, and, of late, the boy has one such episode almost every week. During these episodes, he usually wheezes, coughs, and seems to be winded as if something was restricting his ability to breathe. These symptoms have not affected his sleep at night. This breathlessness does not limit his daily activities, and whenever he does have an episode it subsides after he gets some rest. He does not have any other pertinent medical history and is not on any medication. His physical examination does not reveal any significant findings. The pediatrician checks his expiratory flow rate in the office and estimates it to be around 85% after conducting it three times.

Evaluation of home-monitoring of asthmatic children with the mini-Wright peak flow meter. The amount of medication required to control asthmatic wheezing varies from patient to patient. While the amount required can be assessed clinically from history and physical examination, an objective measurement to assess the patient's requirements is highly desirable. For this purpose the mini-Wright peak flow meter was used. The patient was shown in the office how to use the meter and then sent home to use the meter three times daily for 2 weeks and record each reading on the chart provided. After 2 weeks the chart and meter were mailed to the office where the patient's readings were compared with normal values. Then the patient's medications could be adjusted if necessary. A study of 55 patients showed that this is a very valuable method to assist the practicing physician in prescribing sufficient medication for adequate control, particularly in those patients who minimize their symptoms, either intentionally or unintentionally, so that the physician cannot make an adequate judgment. It was also very useful for convincing the parents or patients that continuous medication is necessary in many cases where they felt PRN medication to be sufficient. The use of this instrument should become a routine part of the management of all difficult asthmatic patients.

It Is Just Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorderâ¦or Is It? Carly is a 5-year-old girl who presents for an interdisciplinary evaluation due to behaviors at school and home suggestive of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parent report of preschool teacher concerns was consistent with ADHD. Psychological testing showed verbal, visual-spatial, and fluid reasoning IQ scores in the average range; processing speed and working memory were below average. Carly's behavior improved when her mother left the room, and she was attentive during testing with a psychologist. Tests of executive function (EF) skills showed mixed results. Working memory was in the borderline range, although scores for response inhibition and verbal fluency were average. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms and EF difficulties were elevated.Carly's parents recently separated; she now lives with her mother and sees her father on weekends. Multiple caregivers with inconsistent approaches to discipline assist with child care while her mother works at night as a medical assistant. Family history is positive for ADHD and learning problems in her father. Medical history is unremarkable. Review of systems is significant for nightly mouth breathing and snoring, but no night waking, bruxism, or daytime sleepiness. She has enlarged tonsils and a high-arched palate on physical examination.At a follow-up visit, parent rating scales are consistent with ADHD-combined type; teacher rating scales support ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type. Snoring has persisted. A sleep study indicated obstructive sleep apnea. After adenotonsillectomy, Carly had significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. She developed recurrence of behavior problems 1 year after the surgery.

Impulse Oscillometry System for the Diagnosis of Wheezing Episode in Children in Office Practice. Objectively differentiating between wheezing episodes and other respiratory disorders will be helpful in treatment in office practice. The impulse oscillometry system has been useful in assessing airway resistance in children 3-6 years old. As the reference values are different in geographical regions the use of the impulse oscillometry is still limited. Comparison between the percent change in IOS parameters as compared to reference standards and changes in actual IOS parameters was done to diagnose wheezing episodes. Three to six years old children with a history of fever, cough, cold, and/or breathlessness with noisy breathing and who were not on any regular medications, whose parents gave consent were recruited in the study. The children underwent an impulse oscillometry system examination as per the guidelines. The test was repeated after they were given nebulization by salbutamol (2.5 mg) (before COVID 19 pandemic). Final diagnosis was done by following patients for 7 days. About 106 children were recruited in the study. Five children could not perform the IOS test. Eighteen children did not complete the follow-up. Hence, 83 children were analyzed. There were 47 males and 36 female patients. The change in actual values of AX, R5, and X20 showed statistically significant difference in wheezing episode group (

Persistent cough in an adolescent. Jessica, a 14-year-old girl with a history of asthma, went to her pediatrician's office because of a persistent cough. She had been coughing for at least 3 months with occasional cough-free periods of less than a few days. The cough was nonproductive and was not accompanied by fever, rhinorrhea, or facial or chest pain. Jessica and her mother observed that the cough increased with exercise and typically was not present during sleep. She has used two metered-dose inhalers--albuterol and cromolyn--without any change in the cough pattern. For the past 5 years, Jessica has had mild asthma responsive to albuterol. She enjoys running on the cross-country team, soccer, and dancing. She is an average student and denies any change in academic performance. She has never been hospitalized or had an emergency department visit for asthma or pneumonia. There has been no recent travel or exposure to a person with a chronic productive cough, tobacco smoke, or a live-in pet. Jessica lives with her mother and younger sister in a 10-year-old, carpeted apartment without any evidence of mold or recent renovation. In the process of taking the history, the pediatrician noticed that Jessica coughed intermittently, with two or three coughs during each episode. At times, the cough was harsh; at other times, it was a quiet cough, as if she were clearing her throat. She was cooperative, without overt anxiety or respiratory distress. After a complete physical examination with normal findings, the pediatrician interviewed Jessica and her mother alone. Jessica's parents had been divorced for the past 6 years. She lived with her mother but visited her father, and his new family with two young children, every weekend. She spoke about this arrangement comfortably and said that she loved her father and mother but didn't like the tension she experienced at her father's home. "I don't like adults arguing when kids are around." When asked why she thought the cough persisted so long, she commented in a neutral tone, "I don't know. It's never been like this before." Jessica's pediatrician prescribed an inhaled steroid with the albuterol. When the cough did not respond after 1 week, he ordered a chest radiograph (normal) and a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative-negative), and he added montelukast (a leukotriene inhibitor) and monitored airway resistance with a peak flow meter. The cough persisted, and the peak flow recording showed normal airway resistance. At this time, Jessica's pediatrician suspected a conversion reaction and contemplated the next best therapeutic strategy.

Test your skills: a worsening rash. A mother brings her 5-year-old boy in to your office because she is concerned about a rash on his legs that seems to be worsening. She tells you that he had a runny nose and a mild cough a week earlier, but that those symptoms resolved before the rash developed. He has also complained of "belly pain." The boy's mother says he has been less active and more irritable since the onset of the rash, and that he is hardly eating. She also tells you that earlier in the day, her son told her that it hurts to walk. A complete review of systems is otherwise negative. The 5-year-old was born at term without complication. He has met all developmental milestones and his immunizations are up to date. He takes no medications. The boy's vital signs are normal. He has an erythematous maculopapular rash distributed on his legs symmetrically; it is palpable, nontender, and nonblanching. You detect no abnormalities in abdominal, neurologic, or musculoskeletal examinations. A complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) reveal mild leukocytosis with a normal differential. Urinalysis shows moderate blood and trace protein. Laboratory results are otherwise normal. What's your diagnosis?


Evaluation of home-monitoring of asthmatic children with the mini-Wright peak flow meter. The amount of medication required to control asthmatic wheezing varies from patient to patient. While the amount required can be assessed clinically from history and physical examination, an objective measurement to assess the patient's requirements is highly desirable. For this purpose the mini-Wright peak flow meter was used. The patient was shown in the office how to use the meter and then sent home to use the meter three times daily for 2 weeks and record each reading on the chart provided. After 2 weeks the chart and meter were mailed to the office where the patient's readings were compared with normal values. Then the patient's medications could be adjusted if necessary. A study of 55 patients showed that this is a very valuable method to assist the practicing physician in prescribing sufficient medication for adequate control, particularly in those patients who minimize their symptoms, either intentionally or unintentionally, so that the physician cannot make an adequate judgment. It was also very useful for convincing the parents or patients that continuous medication is necessary in many cases where they felt PRN medication to be sufficient. The use of this instrument should become a routine part of the management of all difficult asthmatic patients.


It Is Just Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorderâ¦or Is It? Carly is a 5-year-old girl who presents for an interdisciplinary evaluation due to behaviors at school and home suggestive of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parent report of preschool teacher concerns was consistent with ADHD. Psychological testing showed verbal, visual-spatial, and fluid reasoning IQ scores in the average range; processing speed and working memory were below average. Carly's behavior improved when her mother left the room, and she was attentive during testing with a psychologist. Tests of executive function (EF) skills showed mixed results. Working memory was in the borderline range, although scores for response inhibition and verbal fluency were average. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms and EF difficulties were elevated.Carly's parents recently separated; she now lives with her mother and sees her father on weekends. Multiple caregivers with inconsistent approaches to discipline assist with child care while her mother works at night as a medical assistant. Family history is positive for ADHD and learning problems in her father. Medical history is unremarkable. Review of systems is significant for nightly mouth breathing and snoring, but no night waking, bruxism, or daytime sleepiness. She has enlarged tonsils and a high-arched palate on physical examination.At a follow-up visit, parent rating scales are consistent with ADHD-combined type; teacher rating scales support ADHD hyperactive-impulsive type. Snoring has persisted. A sleep study indicated obstructive sleep apnea. After adenotonsillectomy, Carly had significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. She developed recurrence of behavior problems 1 year after the surgery.




Question:
A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician's office by his parents for a scheduled visit. His father tells the physician that he has observed, on several occasions, that his son has difficulty breathing. This is more prominent when he is outside playing with his friends. These symptoms are increased during the spring and winter seasons, and, of late, the boy has one such episode almost every week. During these episodes, he usually wheezes, coughs, and seems to be winded as if something was restricting his ability to breathe. These symptoms have not affected his sleep at night. This breathlessness does not limit his daily activities, and whenever he does have an episode it subsides after he gets some rest.

[Clinical aspects of inflammatory diseases of the large bowel with reference to coloscopy (author's transl)]. Ulcerative colitis and regional colitis Crohn are the most frequent inflammatory diseases of the large bowel in Europe. Clinical differentiation of these disorders are difficult. Diarrhoe with bloody stools are predominant. In cases with Morbus Crohn anorectal fistulas and involvement of the terminal ileum are frequently found. In cases with ulcerative colitis anorectal fistulas are more rare but in this disease a carcinoma of the colon often develops, especially when the course is severe and the involvement of the colon is extended. Clinical symptoms, courses and complications of both diseases are described. In differential diagnoses endoscopic procedures especially coloscopy play an important role. In cases of ulcerative colitis about 90% the rectum is involved. Spontaneous haemorrhage of the colonic mucosa with edema and pseudopolyps are typical endoscopic findings. Most cases with Crohn's disease show flat and irregular ulcers within a normal mucosa. In later stage a "cobble stone" relief is demonstrable. Endoscopy and guided biopsy are not only important for differential diagnosis but also for treatment and prognosis.

A case of Behcet's disease with intestinal involvement due to Crohn's disease. A 15-yr-old, Arabic male presented with painful, recurrent, self-resolving oral and genital ulcers, erythema nodosum and uveitis. Behcet's disease was diagnosed. A few months later, he experienced anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Although all routine laboratory and radiologic investigations were negative, colonoscopy revealed the presence of serpiginous ulcers with pseudopolyps and inflamed intervening mucosa in the proximal half of the colon. Therapy with oral steroids was helpful, but the disease exacerbated a few months after prednisone was discontinued. Repeat evaluation showed similar endoscopic findings and, on colonic biopsy, noncaseating granulomas compatible with Crohn's disease were seen. Again, the patient responded well to oral steroids and sulfasalazine. We believe that gastrointestinal involvement in our patient is compatible with Crohn's disease and that screening tests to rule out chronic inflammatory bowel disease should be performed in the presence of gastrointestinal involvement in Behcet's disease. Behcet's disease may be a part of the spectrum of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

Silent perforation: an iatrogenic complication of colonoscopy. A 55-year-old woman presented with a complaint of 3 months of bloody diarrhea with an approximately 8 stools per day. She initially underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy at an outside hospital with biopsies showing acute and chronic colitis. She was started on asacol 2 tablets 3 times per day. Her symptoms persisted and she was placed on prednisone with only transient improvement in her symptoms. She continued to have diarrhea and malaise with 30-lb weight loss over 2 months. Outpatient colonoscopy was performed for evaluation of this change in bowel habit. Colonoscopy showed 2-cm terminal ileal polyp, focal ulcer of the cecum, and severe ulcerative colitis from mid-ascending colon to rectum, with touch friability, spontaneous bleeding, pseudopolyps, and ulceration. Multiple biopsies were taken of the friable and ulcerated regions. After colonoscopy, the patient remained stable with no complaints of pain. She was then taken for computed tomographic enterography showing severe colitis but also reflecting a large amount of air surrounding the right abdominal structures including the liver, gallbladder, right kidney, and right side of the colon. Air extended inferiorly into the right thigh and superiorly into the chest where it reached the mediastinum and pericardium. There was also a small amount of air in the peritoneal cavity under the diaphragm and adjacent to the liver. These findings were thought most likely secondary to asymptomatic colonic perforation secondary to colonoscopy. The patient remained stable, afebrile, and pain-free small bowel pathology from colonoscopy revealed carcinoid tumor of the terminal ileum. The patient remained stable despite intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal, and subcutaneous free air on follow-up x-ray. Patient underwent elective ileocecectomy 2 weeks later with postoperative films showing no evidence of free air. Iatrogenic perforation of the colon is a rare but feared complication of coloscopy with an incidence in some studies of 0.03% to 0.09%. This case demonstrates asymptomatic colonic perforation to a dramatic effect.

Context:
Endoscopic diagnosis of chronic diarrhea. The prevalence of chronic diarrhea in the general population is reported to be 4%-5%. Since various pathological conditions cause diarrheal symptoms, etiological diagnosis of chronic diarrhea is difficult in many cases. Medical history taking, physical examinations, and laboratory testing are not adequately sensitive or specific, thus a colonoscopic investigation is frequently employed for etiological evaluation. However, for cases with non-bloody chronic diarrhea, the diagnostic yield of a colonoscopy procedure is reported to be not high enough. Furthermore, endoscopically identifiable findings are not adequately specific for the diagnosis of diarrheal disease, except for inflammatory bowel disease, while microscopic colitis, amyloidosis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, celiac disease, and bile acid diarrhea are difficult to definitively diagnose using endoscopic findings. Thus, a histopathological examination of biopsy samples obtained with endoscopy is critically important. Endoscopists should consider obtaining biopsy samples from even normal-appearing gastrointestinal mucosa for chronic diarrhea diagnosis.

Pseudopolyps in inflammatory bowel diseases: Have we learned enough? Pseudopolyps are a well described entity in the literature and even though the exact pathogenesis of their formation is not completely understood, they are considered non-neoplastic lesions originating from the mucosa after repeated periods of inflammation and ulceration associated with excessive healing processes. Their occurrence is less common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, and their overall prevalence ranges from 4% to 74%; moreover, they are found more often in colon but have been detected in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract as well. When their size exceeds the arbitrary point of 1.5 cm, they are classified as giant pseudopolyps. Clinical evaluation should differentiate the pseudopolyps from other polypoid lesions, such as the dysplasia-associated mass or lesion, but this situation represents an ongoing clinical challenge. Pseudopolyps can provoke complications such as bleeding or obstruction, and their management includes medical therapy, endoscopy and surgery; however, no consensus exists about the optimal treatment approach. Patients with pseudopolyps are considered at intermediate risk for colorectal cancer and regular endoscopic monitoring is recommended. Through a review of the literature, we provide here a proposed classification of the characteristics of pseudopolyps.

Does intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring have predictive value for functional recovery following spinal cord injury? A case report. To present a case report of a patient with an ASIA B spinal cord injury with partially intact baseline IONM who made a complete functional recovery postoperatively. A thirty-three year old male presented after a motor vehicle accident. Imaging studies revealed a C4-C5 bilateral facet dislocation. On presentation the patient had 4/5 strength in bilateral biceps and wrist extensors, 3/5 strength in bilateral triceps, and 0/5 strength in the finger flexors, intrinsics and all lower extremity muscles. Motor level was C7. Sensation was grossly intact to light touch throughout all extremities, intact to pinprick from C2 to T7, and absent to pinprick caudal to T7. Rectal tone and contraction were absent. After attempts at closed reduction failed the patient underwent an open reduction and posterior C4-C5 fusion. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) revealed the presence of baseline responses to the posterior tibial nerve using somatosensory evoked potentials and to the right abductor hallucis using transcranial motor evoked potentials. At the 6 weeks postoperative visit the patient had full 5/5 motor strength to all muscles except the left deltoid that was 4/5 due to a rotator cuff injury. This case illustrates a potential prognostic value of IONM. Despite lack of clinical motor function at the time of surgery, IONM was able to illicit a motor response in the right lower extremity. Further prospective studies are needed for further investigation.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke. A 49 year-old man with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement in the right coronary artery in 2010 presented for evaluation of left hemiplegia. He was feeling well until three hours prior to presentation, at which time he fell while walking from his bedroom into the kitchen. After falling, he noticed that his left upper and lower extremities felt weak. He denied any symptoms preceding the fall or any loss of consciousness. On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. A 50-year-old African American woman presented with bilateral lower extremity pain, a history of falls during the past several months, and personality and behavior changes. She had been in good health until approximately 5 months before admission, when she began to fall with increasing frequency, often while going down a flight of stairs. She described these falls as her "legs giving out" and feeling very heavy and unsteady. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness. Her daughter noticed that her gait had become somewhat unsteady during the last several months. Her family also noted a change in her personality at this time. Previously, she had been a very tidy person who took great care with her appearance, who was working as a customer service representative. However, she had become less social and very withdrawn. She had been observed putting on dirty clothes after showering, as well as eating constantly. The patient denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, headaches, vision changes, or tinnitus. She also denied any rashes, muscle pain, or intolerance to heat or cold. There was no history of seizure disorder or depression. Her past medical history was notable only for hypertension and being a passenger in a motor vehicle crash 1 year before admission. She denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and had no travel history other than coming to the United States, as she was originally from Trinidad. On physical examination, she was a moderately obese African American woman with a flat affect, psychomotor slowing, and alopecia of the scalp. She was alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but had a score of 26 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination. She lost points only for recall; she had no difficulty with serial 7s. Her cranial nerves were intact and her speech was fluent, although sparse, and she did not make any paraphasic errors. Her muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities and 1+ in the lower extremities, and toes were downgoing bilaterally. She had intact sensation to light touch and pinprick, but markedly diminished proprioception of her lower extremities bilaterally. She had a wide-based gait with a positive Romberg sign and was markedly ataxic. Rectal examination yielded a positive guaiac test with brown stool, normal tone, and no masses. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia with a hematocrit of 22.7% and a mean corpuscular volume of 118.2 fL. A peripheral smear that was performed on admission, prior to transfusion, revealed macrocytic red cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: diagnosis and management. Over the course of 8 weeks, a 50-year-old man developed progressive bilateral leg and arm weakness, with numbness and tingling of the feet and hands. His symptoms persisted for 6 months, with impaired manual dexterity, arm weakness when brushing his teeth, tripping when walking, inability to climb stairs and gait imbalance. On examination, there is mild proximal and distal weakness of the upper and lower extremity muscles, length-dependent sensory loss of vibratory perception and joint position sense, areflexia, positive Romberg test and steppage gait with bilateral foot drop. Motor nerve conduction studies of the arms and legs show partial conduction blocks in several nerves with nonuniform slowing, and sensory responses are absent in the hands, however, normal sural responses are noted. Lumbar puncture reveals acellular cerebrospinal fluid with elevated protein. After 2 months following treatment, his strength and gait improved significantly, and his sensory symptoms resolved.

Diagnosis and treatment of a patient with bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome secondary to anterior subluxation of bilateral sternoclavicular joints: a case report. Thoracic outlet syndrome may result from a posterior sternoclavicular (SC) joint subluxation, or an anterior SC joint subluxation after surgical fixation. This case report presents the physical therapy management of a patient with bilateral thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) secondary to bilateral idiopathic anterior SC joint subluxation. A 16-year-old female presented with a 2-year history of numbness, tingling, and coldness in bilateral upper extremities, and intermittent headaches with occasional vision loss. Ipsilateral upper extremity symptoms were reproduced with cervical rotation and shoulder flexion and abduction from 90Â° to end of the range. All TOS tests were positive. Passive horizontal abduction, through the plane of scaption, produced anterior subluxation of the ipsilateral SC joint. Sustained posterior glides to the medial clavicle relieved all symptoms during shoulder flexion and the Adson's test. Interventions consisted of manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and the trial of two orthoses. After 12 treatment sessions, the patient's symptoms resolved and she improved by 10 points on the Upper Extremity Functional Index. She had no reproduction of symptoms with the thoracic outlet special tests. She maintained a static hold for 90 sec at 90Â° shoulder flexion, 90Â° shoulder abduction, and full shoulder flexion without symptoms. The outcomes describe a successful intervention for a patient with bilateral TOS secondary to idiopathic bilateral anterior SC joint subluxation. This case suggests that SC joint dysfunction should be considered as a cause of TOS and should be screened during the initial examination.

Does intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring have predictive value for functional recovery following spinal cord injury? A case report. To present a case report of a patient with an ASIA B spinal cord injury with partially intact baseline IONM who made a complete functional recovery postoperatively. A thirty-three year old male presented after a motor vehicle accident. Imaging studies revealed a C4-C5 bilateral facet dislocation. On presentation the patient had 4/5 strength in bilateral biceps and wrist extensors, 3/5 strength in bilateral triceps, and 0/5 strength in the finger flexors, intrinsics and all lower extremity muscles. Motor level was C7. Sensation was grossly intact to light touch throughout all extremities, intact to pinprick from C2 to T7, and absent to pinprick caudal to T7. Rectal tone and contraction were absent. After attempts at closed reduction failed the patient underwent an open reduction and posterior C4-C5 fusion. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) revealed the presence of baseline responses to the posterior tibial nerve using somatosensory evoked potentials and to the right abductor hallucis using transcranial motor evoked potentials. At the 6 weeks postoperative visit the patient had full 5/5 motor strength to all muscles except the left deltoid that was 4/5 due to a rotator cuff injury. This case illustrates a potential prognostic value of IONM. Despite lack of clinical motor function at the time of surgery, IONM was able to illicit a motor response in the right lower extremity. Further prospective studies are needed for further investigation.


Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke.

On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift.

Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

[HIV-infection, HAART (highly-active antiretroviral therapy) and hyperlipidemia]. A 42-year-old man with long-standing HIV-infection (CDC C3) and multiple treatment failures was seen for follow-up 6 months after starting a new HAART (zidovudine, efavirenz, indinavir, ritonavir). The medical history is remarkable for a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, past smoking (10 pack years) and a family history of coronary heart disease of the patient's mother. Physical examination revealed discrete signs of lipoatrophy of the face, arms and legs, but no lipoaccumulation (hip-waist ratio 0.94; body mass index 22 kg/m2). Blood pressure measured 156/92 mmHg. A rise in CD4 cell count from 24/ microL to 60/ microL was noted. For the first time, the HIV viral load decreased to &lt; 50 copies/mL. Concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol were found to be increased to 26 mmol/L (2275 mg/dL) and 15 mmol/L (580 mg/dL), respectively, compared previously normal readings. Other parameters were in the normal range. Continuation of HAART resulted in rising CD4 counts to &gt; 200/ microL and HIV viral load suppression to &lt; 50 copies/mL. Neither dietary measures nor treatment with pravastatin significantly changed the drug-induced mixed hyperlipidemia. Treatment with fenofibrate (200 mg qd), however, was followed by a significant reduction of triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations to 12 mmol/L (1050 mg/dL) and 10 mmol/L (387 mg/dL). Addition of pravastatin did not result in further improvement. Arterial hypertension was diagnosed by ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring (systolic 157+/-11 mmHg; diastolic 97+/-10 mmHg). HAART-induced mixed hyperlipidaemia is likely to increase the cardiovascular risk. According to first estimates, the 3-year risk of myocardial infarction amounts to 1.29 - 2.09 % for our patient. The 3-year risk of HIV progression to AIDS or death is &gt; 30 % if HAART is stopped or fails upon switching due to unknown archived drug resistance. Thus, despite unsatisfactory lipid profiles, a modification of HAART seems only acceptable, if new, equally potent, but less lipidaemic drug combinations are available.




Question:
A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49-Year-Old Man with Fever, Headache and Leg Weakness. A 49-year-old man with an unremarkable past medical history presented to an outside hospital with a five-day history of fever, left leg weakness, myalgia and headache. The patient reported that the illness started as a fever and sore throat and he was originally diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis and prescribed antibiotics. The day after his initial diagnosis, his fever had progressed to include a headache, myalgia, a rash on his upper torso and right shoulder and sudden-onset left leg weakness with preserved sensation. With progressively worsening symptoms, he eventually presented to a local emergency department (ED), five days after his symptoms first started. He was experiencing continued left leg weakness, an inability to ambulate, persistent fevers to 103ÂºF, muscle aches, an intense band-like headache and confusion. The patient denied neck stiffness, photophobia, loss of sensation or any additional muscle weakness. He denied any recent travel aside from work, any sick contacts, recent tick/insect bites, history of sexually transmitted diseases or contact with animals. He reported no history of illicit drug use as well as no recent weight loss, trauma or radiation exposure. The patient had approximately a 10-pack-year tobacco smoking history. For the last ten years he drank about a six-pack of beer daily while onshore (roughly two weeks out of every month). He works on an offshore oil platform. He was not taking any home medications besides his recently prescribed antibiotics. He lived alone at home in a moderately rural area of South Louisiana. His family history was non-contributory.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. Diagnosis: P. carinii pneumonia and primary pulmonary sporotrichosis. PRESENTING FEATURES: A 53-year-old man who had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a 3-month history of increasing dysphagia, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and an episode of syncope. His past medical history was notable for oral and presumptive esophageal candidiasis that was treated with fluconazole 6 months prior to presentation. Three months prior to presentation, he discontinued his medications, and his symptoms of dysphagia recurred. During that time he developed intermittent fevers and chills, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, and a cough productive of white sputum. He also reported a 40-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. On the day prior to presentation, he had chest pain and shortness of breath followed by weakness, dizziness, and a brief syncopal episode. He denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, jaundice, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea. There was no history of alcohol use, and he stopped smoking tobacco approximately 1 month previously. He smoked cocaine but denied injection drug use. The patient had never been on antiretroviral therapy and had never had his CD4 count or viral load measured. On physical examination, the patient was a thin, cachectic man who appeared older than his stated age. His vital signs were notable for blood pressure of 102/69 mm Hg, resting tachycardia of 102 beats per minute, resting oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, normal resting respiratory rate, and a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His oropharynx was clear, with no signs of thrush or mucosal ulcers. His pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. His skin was intact, with no visible petechiae, rashes, nodules, or ulcers. Laboratory studies showed a total white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10(3)/microL, with a total lymphocyte count of 330/microL, hematocrit of 30.2%, a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 219 IU/L. The patient had an absolute CD4 count of 8 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 86,457 copies/mL. His arterial blood gas on room air had a pH of 7.51, a PCO2 of 33 mm Hg, and a PO2 of 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram and serial serum cardiac enzymes were normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral upper lobe patchy infiltrates with left upper lobe consolidation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with contrast showed bilateral ground glass infiltrates with focal consolidation (Figure 1) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Induced sputum was negative for Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, or acid-fast bacilli. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. What is the diagnosis?

Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in an Immunocompetent HIV Patient. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon manifestation in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to the virus's prothrombotic state. Our case involves a 41-year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history of HIV on bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir/alafenamide (Biktarvy), hyperlipidemia, post-traumatic stress disorder, hypogonadism with the cessation of testosterone injections one month prior, and generalized anxiety disorder who presented with retro-orbital headache, intermittent bilateral blurry vision, and flashing lights in the lower lateral left eye for one week. Vitals signs and laboratory studies were within normal limits aside from new iron deficiency anemia. Neurological exam was unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed evidence of a subacute cerebral infarct with hemorrhagic transformation in the right superior parietal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast revealed a small thrombosed cortical vein with surrounding hemorrhage and edema in the same location, in addition to a partial thrombosis of the adjacent superior sagittal sinus, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance venogram (MRV). Although cerebral angiography was performed, no intervention was attempted for the partially occluded sagittal sinus. HIV viral load was undetectable with a robust cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 count on therapy. The patient was treated with strict blood pressure control, a statin, and a heparin drip. He remained stable and was discharged on enoxaparin injections with bridging to warfarin. In summary, appropriate lab testing, imaging, and high clinical suspicion are required for proper diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or CVST in an HIV-positive patient.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke. A 49 year-old man with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement in the right coronary artery in 2010 presented for evaluation of left hemiplegia. He was feeling well until three hours prior to presentation, at which time he fell while walking from his bedroom into the kitchen. After falling, he noticed that his left upper and lower extremities felt weak. He denied any symptoms preceding the fall or any loss of consciousness. On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

[Gastroenteritis with fever, headache and rash after travelling in India]. A 63-year-old patient presented to our emergency unit two days after returning from India suffering from watery diarrhea, nausea, fever and headache. On admission we found a maculopapular rash on his trunk and forehead. Laboratory findings revealed a leuko-thrombopenia and elevated levels of CRP and procalcitonin. We started treatment with ciprofloxacin. After 48 hours of treatment the diarrhea subsided, whereas the rush on his trunk increased. Under the suspicion of rickettsial fever we started doxycycline 200 mg/d. Because of an incipient pneumonia we added ceftriaxon. The patient improved rapidly and the laboratory abnormalities resolved. Serological investigations revealed a significant increase of specific antibodies against Rickettsia typhi. In conclusion, headache with fever and maculopapular rash after traveling to endemic countries should rise suspicion for murine typhus.

Profuse diarrhea induced by Campylobacter. A 31-year-old woman with a five-day prodrome of fever, chills, and diarrhea was hospitalized with severe dehydration and profuse diarrhea due to infection with Campylobacter jejuni. Stool volumes were as high as 8,800 ml per 24 hours. Treatment with intravenous fluids, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and an oral isotonic glucose-sodium solution produced rapid improvement, suggesting a possible role for oral fluid and electrolyte replacement in Campylobacter enteritis.

[Traveller's diarrhea: epidemiology, clinical practice guideline for the prevention and treatment]. Bacterial causes are predominant: enterotoxigenic (ETEC) ou enteroadherent Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Acrobacter sp., enterotoxigenic BacteroÃ¯des fragilis. Prevention relies on the hand and food hygiene standards (heat-cooked meals). Watery diarrhea (toxigenic enterocolitis) is the most frequent clinical presentation associated with a risk of dehydration; the body temperature is normal except in cases of severe dehydration. Less frequent are invasive enterocolitis presenting as acute febrile diarrhea with dysentery (abdominal cramps, tenesmus, stools blended with mucus and blood): salmonellosis, shigellosis. Bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients. Early rehydration is essential with oral rehydration solutions (ORS) consisting of salt, sugar and water. Antibiotics should be reserved for invasive enterocolitis with fever and dysentery, profuse diarrhea with more than three liquid stools within 12 hours. Duration of antibiotherapy varies from 1 to 5 days.

Capillariasis: chronic watery diarrhea--not only from microorganisms. A 54-year-old male Thai patient from Prachin Buri Province presented with a history of chronic watery diarrhea for many years. He passed stool five to ten times per day with occasionally colicky pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. He had visited hospitals and private clinics and received treatment but with no improvement. He presented to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand, where on physical examination, he had moderate dehydration, weakness, abdominal distension and a gurgling abdomen. The eggs, larvae and adult worms of Capillaria philippinensis were found on stool examination. The patient was admitted and treated with Mebendazole for 20 days, whereupon his symptoms resolved. Two months previously, he had ingested a raw small fresh-water fish dish called "Phra-Pla Siw/Soi". Small fresh-water fish near the patient's home were collected and examined for Capillaria philippinensis larva. The results were negative for parasitic organisms.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection in sexually active adolescents and young women. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infections among Polish teenagers is unknown. Sexually active adolescents are at a greater risk for sexually transmitted infections, including Chlamydia trachomatis (ChT). Most inflections are asymptomatic and therefore untreated. Early detection and treatment of cervical chlamydial infections can prevent pelvic inflammatory disease and has a strong protective effect against infertility. To determine the prevalence and risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infections among sexually active female adolescents attending the outpatient gynaecological clinic of the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. 249 sexually active girls, 16-19 years old, attending the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw were enrolled in this study from December 2002 to May 2004, The participants filled out a questionnaire containing informations on age, purpose of the visit, level of education, age of the first intercourse, number of lifetime sexual partners, number of current partners (in the last 3 months), number of sexual partners in the past (patients' partner), contraceptive methods, use of condoms at the first and the last intercourse, past history of STD and obstetric history at first visit. Pelvic examination was done for the following reasons: checking vaginal discharge, presence of abnormalities of the cervix such as ectopy, erythroplakia and uterine tenderness and taking a Pap smear and a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis detection. Cervical swabs for Chlamydia trachomatis were tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The prevalence of ChT genital infection in the studied group was 3.2%. Adolescent females infected by ChT less frequently reported the use of condom and more often did not use any contraception in comparison with the girls without ChT genital infections (42.8% and 42.8% vs. 49% and 12.8%), The existence of other STDs was more frequently noted in adolescents with Chlamydial infection in comparison to healthy girls (14.2% vs. 8.3%). There were no statistically significant differences in results of the Pap smears and the incidence of cervical ectopy between the two groups.

Testing for Chlamydia and sexual history taking in adolescent females: results from a statewide survey of Colorado primary care providers. Little is known about the practice patterns of primary care providers as they relate to assessing risk of and screening for chlamydial infections, an important cause of preventable reproductive morbidity in young women in the United States. The present cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess levels of chlamydia testing, sexual history taking, and prevention practices by Colorado primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who provide gynecologic care to adolescent females (13-19 years old). Between July 1998 and October 1998, an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a 25% random sample (n = 1265) of Colorado physicians (family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, obstetrician-gynecologists, and pediatricians), nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Practitioners were identified through professional organization membership, state-licensing bodies, and listings in the yellow pages. After estimating the eligibility rate among non-respondents, the adjusted response rate was 71.5%. Only 53.8% of providers reported regularly testing sexually active female adolescents for chlamydia; 71.8% of providers regularly took a sexual history. Female providers reported significantly higher levels of regularly taking a sexual history (87. 2% vs 60.6% of males), feeling comfortable discussing sex (94.4% vs 77.8%), discussing sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention (81. 5% vs 71.3%), and testing for chlamydia (64.4% vs 38.6%). Among provider types, obstetrician-gynecologists, nurse practitioners, and pediatricians were most likely to report regularly taking a sexual history (90.1%, 88.6%, and 76.0%, respectively). Internal medicine specialists were the least likely to report taking a sexual history (43.9%). Pediatricians and nurse practitioners were the most likely to report testing sexually active adolescent females for chlamydia (74.1% and 70.1%, respectively), whereas physician assistants and internal medicine specialists were the least likely (46.0% and 38.5%, respectively). In multivariate analysis, variables independently associated with regularly taking a sexual history included female provider gender (odds ratio [OR]: 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-10.9), obstetrics/gynecology specialty (OR: 4.0; 95% CI: 1.7-10. 3; referent group: family practitioners), and provider comfort level in discussing sex (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 2.3-11.1). Variables independently associated with regularly testing adolescent females for chlamydia included female provider gender (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1. 6-4.8), regularly discussing STD prevention (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4. 1), and regularly discussing limiting the number of patients' sex partners (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4-4.1). Only a little over one half of providers (54%) reported regularly performing chlamydia tests on adolescent females who are sexually active by history. Because this falls well short of the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test all sexually active female adolescents, efforts are needed to improve STD clinical practices of Colorado physician and nonphysician providers of primary care for adolescent females. Particular efforts are needed to close the provider gender gap.

Clinician adherence to recommendations for screening of adolescents for sexual activity and sexually transmitted infection/human immunodeficiency virus. To evaluate clinician adherence to guidelines for documentation of sexual history and screening for sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV infection during routine adolescent well visits. Secondary objectives were to determine patient and clinician factors associated with sexual history documentation and STI/HIV testing. Retrospective, cross-sectional study of 1000 randomly selected 13- to 19-year-old routine well visits at all 29 pediatric primary care practices affiliated with a children's hospital. We evaluated frequency of documentation of sexual history and testing for gonorrhea (GC)/chlamydia (CT) and HIV testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with documentation and testing. Of the 1000 patient visits reviewed, 212 (21.2%; 95% CI, 18.7-23.7) had a documented sexual history, of which 45 adolescents' (21.2%; 95% CI, 15.7-26.8) encounters were documented as being sexually active. Overall, 26 (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.6-3.6) patients were tested for GC/CT and 16 (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.8-2.4) were tested for HIV infection. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with sexual history documentation included older patient age, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, nonprivate insurance status, and care by female clinician. Factors associated with GC/CT testing included male gender, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and nonprivate insurance. HIV testing was more likely to be performed on older adolescents, those of non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and those with nonprivate insurance. Pediatric primary care clinicians infrequently document sexual histories and perform STI and HIV testing on adolescent patients. Future studies should investigate provider beliefs, clinical decision-making principles, and perceived barriers to improve the sexual health care of adolescents and evaluate interventions to increase rates of adolescent sexual health screening.

Testing adolescents for sexually transmitted infections in urban primary care practices: results from a baseline study. Sexually active urban adolescents experience a high burden of sexually transmitted infections (STI). Adolescents often access medical care through general primary care providers; their time alone with a provider increases the likelihood that youth will disclose risky behavior, which may result in STI testing. Our goals were to assess the association (if any) between the provision of time alone and STI testing, and describe the rates of STI testing among sexually active adolescents in urban primary care. Youth (aged 12-19 years) presenting for care at 4 urban health centers were invited to complete post-visit surveys of their experience. Sexually transmitted infection screening rates were obtained from the clinical information systems (CIS); CIS data were linked to survey responses. We received 101 surveys. Surveyed youth experienced time alone in 69% of all visits. Time alone varied by age (older teens experienced more time alone), and it occurred more frequently in preventive visits (71%) versus nonpreventive visits (33%). It did not vary by gender. Forty-two of the 46 sexually active youth experienced time alone. Screening rates for sexually active females, either at the index visit or within 6 months prior to the index visit, were 17.9% for human immunodeficiency virus and 32.1% for gonorrhea/Chlamydia. No sexually active surveyed males were tested. Overall screening rates varied widely across practices (human immunodeficiency virus 0%-29%; gonorrhea/Chlamydia 7%-29%). There was no difference in screening rates among youth with and without time alone. STI testing for adolescents is being conducted in this primary care urban population, especially for sexually active females. However, clinicians in this setting are not screening females consistently enough and rarely screen males. We were unable to test our hypothesis that provision of time alone was associated with a higher rate of STI testing. Site differences suggest substantial variation in clinician practices that should be addressed in quality improvement interventions.

The adolescent patient. The physician must establish a confidential and trusting relationship with the adolescent patient. All states allow treatment of adolescents over 18 without parental consent and some allow treatment for special problems such as venereal disease or drug abuse before 18. The depressed adolescent often presents with behavioral problems, school failure, or medical symptoms. The medical history should include a description of the pregnancy and delivery, immunizations and childhood diseases, family history of coronary disease, sexual activity, school performance, and drug use. The physical examination should include an evaluation of growth and sexual development, blood pressure determination, a breast examination in older teenagers, and a pelvic examination if the patient is sexually active or if a gynecologic problem is suspected. All adolescent patients need a urine analysis and hematocrit test. Sexually active patients need a serologic test for syphilis, gonorrhea culture, and Papanicolaou smear. Determination of cholesterol and triglyceride are needed when there is a history of a myocardial infarction in a first-degree relative younger than age 50 years.




Question:
A 16-year-old girl comes to her primary care physician for an annual check-up. She has no specific complaints. Her medical history is significant for asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed. She has no notable surgical history. Her mom had breast cancer and her grandfather died of colon cancer. She received all her childhood scheduled vaccinations up to age 8. She reports that she is doing well in school but hates math. She is sexually active with her boyfriend. They use condoms consistently, and they both tested negative recently for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. She asks about birth control. In addition to educating the patient on her options for contraception, which of the following is the best next step in management?

Chlamydia trachomatis infection in sexually active adolescents and young women. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infections among Polish teenagers is unknown. Sexually active adolescents are at a greater risk for sexually transmitted infections, including Chlamydia trachomatis (ChT). Most inflections are asymptomatic and therefore untreated. Early detection and treatment of cervical chlamydial infections can prevent pelvic inflammatory disease and has a strong protective effect against infertility. To determine the prevalence and risk factors of Chlamydia trachomatis infections among sexually active female adolescents attending the outpatient gynaecological clinic of the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. 249 sexually active girls, 16-19 years old, attending the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw were enrolled in this study from December 2002 to May 2004, The participants filled out a questionnaire containing informations on age, purpose of the visit, level of education, age of the first intercourse, number of lifetime sexual partners, number of current partners (in the last 3 months), number of sexual partners in the past (patients' partner), contraceptive methods, use of condoms at the first and the last intercourse, past history of STD and obstetric history at first visit. Pelvic examination was done for the following reasons: checking vaginal discharge, presence of abnormalities of the cervix such as ectopy, erythroplakia and uterine tenderness and taking a Pap smear and a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis detection. Cervical swabs for Chlamydia trachomatis were tested by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The prevalence of ChT genital infection in the studied group was 3.2%. Adolescent females infected by ChT less frequently reported the use of condom and more often did not use any contraception in comparison with the girls without ChT genital infections (42.8% and 42.8% vs. 49% and 12.8%), The existence of other STDs was more frequently noted in adolescents with Chlamydial infection in comparison to healthy girls (14.2% vs. 8.3%). There were no statistically significant differences in results of the Pap smears and the incidence of cervical ectopy between the two groups.


Testing for Chlamydia and sexual history taking in adolescent females: results from a statewide survey of Colorado primary care providers. Little is known about the practice patterns of primary care providers as they relate to assessing risk of and screening for chlamydial infections, an important cause of preventable reproductive morbidity in young women in the United States. The present cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess levels of chlamydia testing, sexual history taking, and prevention practices by Colorado primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who provide gynecologic care to adolescent females (13-19 years old). Between July 1998 and October 1998, an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a 25% random sample (n = 1265) of Colorado physicians (family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, obstetrician-gynecologists, and pediatricians), nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Practitioners were identified through professional organization membership, state-licensing bodies, and listings in the yellow pages. After estimating the eligibility rate among non-respondents, the adjusted response rate was 71.5%. Only 53.8% of providers reported regularly testing sexually active female adolescents for chlamydia; 71.8% of providers regularly took a sexual history. Female providers reported significantly higher levels of regularly taking a sexual history (87. 2% vs 60.6% of males), feeling comfortable discussing sex (94.4% vs 77.8%), discussing sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention (81. 5% vs 71.3%), and testing for chlamydia (64.4% vs 38.6%). Among provider types, obstetrician-gynecologists, nurse practitioners, and pediatricians were most likely to report regularly taking a sexual history (90.1%, 88.6%, and 76.0%, respectively). Internal medicine specialists were the least likely to report taking a sexual history (43.9%). Pediatricians and nurse practitioners were the most likely to report testing sexually active adolescent females for chlamydia (74.1% and 70.1%, respectively), whereas physician assistants and internal medicine specialists were the least likely (46.0% and 38.5%, respectively). In multivariate analysis, variables independently associated with regularly taking a sexual history included female provider gender (odds ratio [OR]: 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.9-10.9), obstetrics/gynecology specialty (OR: 4.0; 95% CI: 1.7-10. 3; referent group: family practitioners), and provider comfort level in discussing sex (OR: 4.9; 95% CI: 2.3-11.1). Variables independently associated with regularly testing adolescent females for chlamydia included female provider gender (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1. 6-4.8), regularly discussing STD prevention (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4. 1), and regularly discussing limiting the number of patients' sex partners (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4-4.1). Only a little over one half of providers (54%) reported regularly performing chlamydia tests on adolescent females who are sexually active by history. Because this falls well short of the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test all sexually active female adolescents, efforts are needed to improve STD clinical practices of Colorado physician and nonphysician providers of primary care for adolescent females. Particular efforts are needed to close the provider gender gap.

Clinician adherence to recommendations for screening of adolescents for sexual activity and sexually transmitted infection/human immunodeficiency virus. To evaluate clinician adherence to guidelines for documentation of sexual history and screening for sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV infection during routine adolescent well visits. Secondary objectives were to determine patient and clinician factors associated with sexual history documentation and STI/HIV testing. Retrospective, cross-sectional study of 1000 randomly selected 13- to 19-year-old routine well visits at all 29 pediatric primary care practices affiliated with a children's hospital. We evaluated frequency of documentation of sexual history and testing for gonorrhea (GC)/chlamydia (CT) and HIV testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with documentation and testing. Of the 1000 patient visits reviewed, 212 (21.2%; 95% CI, 18.7-23.7) had a documented sexual history, of which 45 adolescents' (21.2%; 95% CI, 15.7-26.8) encounters were documented as being sexually active. Overall, 26 (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.6-3.6) patients were tested for GC/CT and 16 (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.8-2.4) were tested for HIV infection. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with sexual history documentation included older patient age, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, nonprivate insurance status, and care by female clinician. Factors associated with GC/CT testing included male gender, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and nonprivate insurance. HIV testing was more likely to be performed on older adolescents, those of non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and those with nonprivate insurance. Pediatric primary care clinicians infrequently document sexual histories and perform STI and HIV testing on adolescent patients. Future studies should investigate provider beliefs, clinical decision-making principles, and perceived barriers to improve the sexual health care of adolescents and evaluate interventions to increase rates of adolescent sexual health screening.

Splenectomy for children with thalassemia. Twenty-three children with thalassemia (18 with beta-thalassemia major, 3 with Hb H disease, and 2 with thalassemia intermediate) had total splenectomy (nine beta-thalassemia major patients and two thalassemia intermediate patients) or partial splenectomy (nine beta-thalassemia patients and three Hb H disease patients) as part of their management at our hospital. There were 10 males and 1 female in the total splenectomy group (mean age, 7.8 years; range, 4.5-12 years), and 4 males and 8 females in the partial splenectomy group (mean age, 6.9 years; range, 3-10 years). In all, the indication for splenectomy was hypersplenism. In the partial splenectomy group, two children with Hb H disease required no further blood transfusions. The transfusion requirements of the third patient with Hb H disease decreased from 15 to 11 transfusions per year (from 1.2 g/week Hb drop preoperatively to 0.7 g/week postoperatively), but subsequently his transfusion requirements increased as a result of an increase in the size of splenic remnant. He underwent total splenectomy 1.5 years post-partial splenectomy. For those with beta-thalassemia major who had partial splenectomy, there was a reduction in the number of blood transfusions from a preoperative mean of 15.2 transfusions per year (range, 11-22 transfusions per year) to a postoperative mean of 8.2 transfusions per year (range, 2-11 transfusions per year). Their Hb drop decreased from a preoperative mean of 1.6 g/week (range, 0.8-3.5 g/week) to a postoperative mean of 0.5 g/week (range, 0.2-0.75 g/week). Subsequently and as a result of increase in the size of splenic remnant, their transfusion requirements increased, but none of them to this point have required total splenectomy. Eleven children had total splenectomy. Their postsplenectomy transfusion requirements decreased from a preoperative mean of 17.8 transfusions per year (range, 12-23 transfusions per year) to a postoperative mean of 10 transfusions per year (range, 8-12 transfusions per year), and their Hb drop decreased from a preoperative mean of 1.8 g/week (range, 0.5-2.3 g/week) to a postoperative mean of 0.45 g/week (range, 0.3-0.65 g/week). In conclusion, total splenectomy is beneficial for children with thalassemia and hypersplenism because it reduces their transfusion requirements. Partial splenectomy may be beneficial for those with Hb H disease. However, for those with beta-thalassemia, partial splenectomy is beneficial in reducing their transfusion requirements only as a temporary measure, and it is recommended for children who are less than 5 years of age.

Hb Bristol-Alesha presenting thalassemia-type hyperunstable hemoglobinopathy. Hemoglobin (Hb) Bristol-Alesha is caused by a GTG --&gt; ATG mutation at codon 67 in the Hb beta chain, resulting in abnormal beta globin chains with mutated molecules from normal beta67 valine (Val) to beta67 methionine (Met) or beta67 aspartate (Asp). We describe a Japanese child with this rare hemoglobinopathy and a very unstable Hb molecule phenotype. The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia was made when the patient was 6 months of age. Development of marked splenomegaly necessitated red blood cell transfusions twice a month. After splenectomy when the patient was 4 years of age, laboratory findings of hemolytic anemia became more prominent. Specific abnormal Hb molecules initially were not detected, and the alpha/beta globin synthesis ratio was abnormal at 2.22. After splenectomy, we identified the presence of abnormal beta-globin chains with a beta67Val:beta67Met:beta67Asp molecule ratio of 74:11:15. We speculate that the high fraction of the beta67Met molecule in this patient, compared with that in previously reported cases, caused extreme Hb instability, which resulted in thalassemic hyperunstable hemoglobinopathy and very severe clinical findings.

The role of partial splenectomy in children with thalassemia. Partial splenectomy was performed on 12 patients with thalassemia (9 beta-thalassemia major and 3 Hb H disease) to reduce blood transfusion requirements. The indication for partial splenectomy was the presence of splenomegaly and increased blood transfusion requirements (i.e. Hb drop &gt; 0.5 g per week). Their ages ranged from 3 to 10 years (mean 6.9 years). On follow-up, ranging from 1.1-5.5 years (mean 2.6 years), two of the three patients with Hb H disease required no more blood transfusions while the third continued to receive blood transfusions, but at a lower frequency. For those with beta-thalassemia major, the transfusion requirements and Hb drop per week decreased in the majority of patients. This is specially so during the first 1-2 years following partial splenectomy. In all, about 1/3 of the size of the normal spleen was preserved (either upper or lower pole) which was judged functional as there has been no significant infection in any of the patients, no change in IgM level, no Howell-Jolly bodies and visualization on scintigraphy. Partial splenectomy is recommended to start with for those with Hb H disease. For patients with beta-thalassemia major, partial splenectomy is beneficial as a temporary measure and in those children who are less than 5 years of age, as they are at greater risk of post splenectomy sepsis.

Hypercoagulability in non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. Beta (Î²)-thalassemia is characterized by a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of thrombosis, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to hypercoagulability are diverse and include chronic platelet activation, alteration of red blood cell membranes, abnormal expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells, and dysregulation of hemostasis. Regular transfusions decrease the risk of thrombosis, whereas splenectomy significantly increases the risk. Splenectomized adults with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia are also at high risk for ischemic brain damage. Strategies to lower the risk of thrombosis should be considered, including transfusion therapy to raise hemoglobin levels and avoidance or delay of splenectomy.

Twenty-three children with thalassemia (18 with beta-thalassemia major, 3 with Hb H disease, and 2 with thalassemia intermediate) had total splenectomy (nine beta-thalassemia major patients and two thalassemia intermediate patients) or partial splenectomy (nine beta-thalassemia patients and three Hb H disease patients) as part of their management at our hospital. There were 10 males and 1 female in the total splenectomy group (mean age, 7.8 years; range, 4.5-12 years), and 4 males and 8 females in the partial splenectomy group (mean age, 6.9 years; range, 3-10 years). In all, the indication for splenectomy was hypersplenism. In the partial splenectomy group, two children with Hb H disease required no further blood transfusions. The transfusion requirements of the third patient with Hb H disease decreased from 15 to 11 transfusions per year (from 1.2 g/week Hb drop preoperatively to 0.7 g/week postoperatively), but subsequently his transfusion requirements increased as a result of an increase in the size of splenic remnant. He underwent total splenectomy 1.5 years post-partial splenectomy. For those with beta-thalassemia major who had partial splenectomy, there was a reduction in the number of blood transfusions from a preoperative mean of 15.2 transfusions per year (range, 11-22 transfusions per year) to a postoperative mean of 8.2 transfusions per year (range, 2-11 transfusions per year). Their Hb drop decreased from a preoperative mean of 1.6 g/week (range, 0.8-3.5 g/week) to a postoperative mean of 0.5 g/week (range, 0.2-0.75 g/week). Subsequently and as a result of increase in the size of splenic remnant, their transfusion requirements increased, but none of them to this point have required total splenectomy. Eleven children had total splenectomy. Their postsplenectomy transfusion requirements decreased from a preoperative mean of 17.8 transfusions per year (range, 12-23 transfusions per year) to a postoperative mean of 10 transfusions per year (range, 8-12 transfusions per year), and their Hb drop decreased from a preoperative mean of 1.8 g/week (range, 0.5-2.3 g/week) to a postoperative mean of 0.45 g/week (range, 0.3-0.65 g/week). In conclusion, total splenectomy is beneficial for children with thalassemia and hypersplenism because it reduces their transfusion requirements. Partial splenectomy may be beneficial for those with Hb H disease. However, for those with beta-thalassemia, partial splenectomy is beneficial in reducing their transfusion requirements only as a temporary measure, and it is recommended for children who are less than 5 years of age.

Hb Bristol-Alesha presenting thalassemia-type hyperunstable hemoglobinopathy. Hemoglobin (Hb) Bristol-Alesha is caused by a GTG --&gt; ATG mutation at codon 67 in the Hb beta chain, resulting in abnormal beta globin chains with mutated molecules from normal beta67 valine (Val) to beta67 methionine (Met) or beta67 aspartate (Asp). We describe a Japanese child with this rare hemoglobinopathy and a very unstable Hb molecule phenotype. The diagnosis of hemolytic anemia was made when the patient was 6 months of age. Development of marked splenomegaly necessitated red blood cell transfusions twice a month. After splenectomy when the patient was 4 years of age, laboratory findings of hemolytic anemia became more prominent. Specific abnormal Hb molecules initially were not detected, and the alpha/beta globin synthesis ratio was abnormal at 2.22. After splenectomy, we identified the presence of abnormal beta-globin chains with a beta67Val:beta67Met:beta67Asp molecule ratio of 74:11:15. We speculate that the high fraction of the beta67Met molecule in this patient, compared with that in previously reported cases, caused extreme Hb instability, which resulted in thalassemic hyperunstable hemoglobinopathy and very severe clinical findings.

Patient Outcomes Following Injury from Hysteroscopic Sterilization. We present clinical data on two patients who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization (HS) 11 years apart using the EssureÂ® (Bayer Inc., Whippany, NJ) device. Symptoms and resolution are described for symptomatic EssureÂ® patients. Case 1 (G3P1) underwent HS in 2004 at age 21. Performed in a physician's office without anesthesia, HS involved placement of &gt;2 EssureÂ® devices which was followed by severe, unrelenting pelvic pain. Confirmatory hysterosalpingogram (HSG) three months after HS revealed five devices. Surgical costs for laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) were fully reimbursed by the device manufacturer seven months later. Case 2 (G8P4) underwent HS in 2015 at age 32. One year earlier, the patient's right fallopian tube was removed due to ectopic pregnancy. EssureÂ® devices were placed bilaterally in a physician's office without anesthesia; HS was accompanied by sharp pelvic pain. The patient obtained HSG three weeks after HS due to constant discomfort. Bilateral tubal occlusion was verified, but abnormal device loop configuration suggesting myometrial penetration was noted on the right. At laparoscopy, the left EssureÂ® device was excised intact but the right coil could not be located. Thus far, there has been no offer in Case 2 from the device manufacturer to offset medical expenses. While HS has been FDA approved for use in the United States since 2002, this is the first description of clinical sequela when FDA labeling for the EssureÂ® procedure is ignored. These cases illustrate the importance of proper physician training in HS and underscore the need for improved tracking of EssureÂ® associated symptoms.

[Endometriosis with massive hemorrhagic ascites: a case report and review of the literature]. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It generally involves the peritoneum, ovaries and rectovaginal septum. Its characteristic symptoms include dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia and infertility. It may also involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract or extra abdominal sites, giving rise to a wide variety of clinical symptoms such as bloody stools, renal haemorrhage, hemoptysis and pleural effusion during menstruation. Recurrent hemorrhagic ascites secondary to endometriosis is an unusual occurrence, 41 cases have been reported since 1954. Here we report an additional case, in order to draw attention to this condition. A 28 years-old black nulligravida woman was seen for the first time in april 2000 with a chief complaint of infertility. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had regular menses but associated with severe dysmenorrhea. She also recalled abdominal and pelvic pain for several years. She underwent an ovulation induction with gonadotrophin, which resulted in a progressive increase of pelvic pain. A first laparoscopy was performed, revealing voluminous ascites (10 I). Two years later the ascites recurred spontaneously. Ultrasound examination revealed suspect "para uterine masses". A second exploratory laparoscopy showed a voluminous bloody ascites (71), and extensive adhesions. On histologic examination all specimens (peritoneal biopsies) were compatible with endometriosis and ruled out malignancy. Treatment with Gn RH analog was performed and full remission was obtained after 6 months. One year later the ascites recurred again spontaneously, leading to a third laparoscopy in an other medical institution. Histologic examination showed endometrial stromal tissue and fibrous proliferation. Later she became pregnant after in vitro fertilization. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the pelvic ultrasound showed only a small effusion in the pouch of Douglas. Still, the ascites did not progress during pregnancy. The patient was hospitalized from 27 to 33 weeks of gestational age for threatened labor, but she finally had a normal vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestational age. Four months later, she had no complaint, but the pelvic ultrasound showed the recurrence of the ascites. She will have a drainage. The future treatement will consists of GnRH analog for about six months, which will be relayed by a long term progestative therapy. A diagnosis of endometriosis should always be considered in middle-age women who presents with bloody ascites. Long follow-up is advisable for patients who undergo conservative treatment because of thehigh risk of recurrence.

Infertile couples with a normal hysterosalpingogram. Reproductive outcome and its relationship to clinical and laparoscopic findings. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the clinical course of infertile couples following a normal hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to determine the reproductive outcome and assess the diagnostic value of subsequent laparoscopy (LSC). The infertile couples (N = 132) were aged 29 +/- 0.5 SD years, with 3.2 +/- 0.4 years of infertility, and were followed for an average of 17 +/- 1.5 months after the HSG. Twenty-nine percent of patients became pregnant after a normal HSG performed with water-soluble contrast medium. There was a fourfold greater rate of pregnancy during the first three months after a normal HSG than during any other three-month interval up to one year. Thirty-four of the initial 132 patients required laparoscopy because of failure to conceive or suspected pelvic disease based on symptoms or the results of a pelvic examination. Among the 34 patients receiving LSC, pelvic pathology was found in 19 (56%). Corrective surgery and/or a change in therapy occurred in 60% of cases after LSC. There was an increased proportion of abnormal findings with increasing time intervals between HSG and LSC but not with increasing intervals of infertility before HSG. Abnormal uterine bleeding was predictive of abnormalities at LSC, while prior use of oral contraceptives correlated negatively with pelvic pathology. In women in infertile couples who have a normal HSG: (1) LSC should not be performed before three months after a normal HSG because of the potential therapeutic effect of HSG, (2) LSC should be performed after a normal HSG if pregnancy has not occurred by at least one year because of the high incidence of pelvic pathology, and (3) HSG using water-soluble contrast media has a therapeutic effect comparable to that described for oil-soluble contrast media.

Fertility and Endocrine Preservation in the Management of Colorectal Cancer in Women. A 28-year-old nulliparous woman presented with rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed a 4-cm malignant-appearing mass in the proximal rectum, and biopsies confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Computed tomography scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease. Staging MRI found transmural extension with minimal stranding in the adjacent fat, as well as no evidence of pathological pelvic adenopathy, consistent with a T3N0 lesion. The proposed treatment plan involved neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy before primary surgical resection. The patient desired fertility preservation and was referred immediately to Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. She underwent assisted reproduction with oocyte and blastocyst cryopreservation followed by laparoscopic ovarian transposition. Nine months after surgical low anterior resection of the tumor and completion of her cancer treatment, her ovaries were repositioned to their normal pelvic position during an ileostomy takedown procedure. She underwent a frozen embryo transfer but did not conceive. She resumed menses and later conceived spontaneously. Her pregnancy was complicated by cervical incompetence, requiring cervical cerclage. She delivered a live male infant via cesarean delivery at 32 weeks gestation, approximately 2 years after completion of cancer therapy. Four years after diagnosis, the patient remains in remission with undetectable CEA levels.

Dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common gynecologic complaints of young women, affecting approximately half of menstruating females. Although most patients have primary dysmenorrhea, which although creating much discomfort does not lead to significant physical problems, it is very important to rule out secondary dysmenorrhea to prevent problems with health and fertility. Primary dysmenorrhea is seen only in ovulatory cycles, usually developing within 6 to 12 months of menarche and is characterized by lower midabdominal colicky pain that may radiate to the back and upper thighs. The pain of primary dysmenorrhea starts with the onset of menstrual flow or a few hours following onset and may last for a few hours up to 2 days. The pain of secondary dysmenorrhea usually begins several days before the start of menstrual flow and may be present during much of the menstrual cycle. Pain that occurs with the first menses or after the age of 25 or is associated with anovulatory cycles is more likely to be secondary dysmenorrhea. The causes of secondary dysmenorrhea, such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, complications of intrauterine devices, and congenital abnormalities, will often be associated with abnormalities noted on pelvic examination, and whenever dysmenorrheic patients have any abnormalities, further evaluation is necessary.

Surgical costs for laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) were fully reimbursed by the device manufacturer seven months later. Case 2 (G8P4) underwent HS in 2015 at age 32. One year earlier, the patient's right fallopian tube was removed due to ectopic pregnancy. EssureÂ® devices were placed bilaterally in a physician's office without anesthesia; HS was accompanied by sharp pelvic pain. The patient obtained HSG three weeks after HS due to constant discomfort. Bilateral tubal occlusion was verified, but abnormal device loop configuration suggesting myometrial penetration was noted on the right. At laparoscopy, the left EssureÂ® device was excised intact but the right coil could not be located. Thus far, there has been no offer in Case 2 from the device manufacturer to offset medical expenses. While HS has been FDA approved for use in the United States since 2002, this is the first description of clinical sequela when FDA labeling for the EssureÂ® procedure is ignored. These cases illustrate the importance of proper physician training in HS and underscore the need for improved tracking of EssureÂ® associated symptoms.


[Endometriosis with massive hemorrhagic ascites: a case report and review of the literature]. Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It generally involves the peritoneum, ovaries and rectovaginal septum. Its characteristic symptoms include dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia and infertility. It may also involve the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract or extra abdominal sites, giving rise to a wide variety of clinical symptoms such as bloody stools, renal haemorrhage, hemoptysis and pleural effusion during menstruation. Recurrent hemorrhagic ascites secondary to endometriosis is an unusual occurrence, 41 cases have been reported since 1954. Here we report an additional case, in order to draw attention to this condition. A 28 years-old black nulligravida woman was seen for the first time in april 2000 with a chief complaint of infertility. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had regular menses but associated with severe dysmenorrhea. She also recalled abdominal and pelvic pain for several years. She underwent an ovulation induction with gonadotrophin, which resulted in a progressive increase of pelvic pain. A first laparoscopy was performed, revealing voluminous ascites (10 I). Two years later the ascites recurred spontaneously. Ultrasound examination revealed suspect "para uterine masses". A second exploratory laparoscopy showed a voluminous bloody ascites (71), and extensive adhesions. On histologic examination all specimens (peritoneal biopsies) were compatible with endometriosis and ruled out malignancy. Treatment with Gn RH analog was performed and full remission was obtained after 6 months. One year later the ascites recurred again spontaneously, leading to a third laparoscopy in an other medical institution. Histologic examination showed endometrial stromal tissue and fibrous proliferation. Later she became pregnant after in vitro fertilization. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the pelvic ultrasound showed only a small effusion in the pouch of Douglas. Still, the ascites did not progress during pregnancy. The patient was hospitalized from 27 to 33 weeks of gestational age for threatened labor, but she finally had a normal vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestational age. Four months later, she had no complaint, but the pelvic ultrasound showed the recurrence of the ascites. She will have a drainage. The future treatement will consists of GnRH analog for about six months, which will be relayed by a long term progestative therapy. A diagnosis of endometriosis should always be considered in middle-age women who presents with bloody ascites. Long follow-up is advisable for patients who undergo conservative treatment because of thehigh risk of recurrence.


Infertile couples with a normal hysterosalpingogram. Reproductive outcome and its relationship to clinical and laparoscopic findings. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the clinical course of infertile couples following a normal hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to determine the reproductive outcome and assess the diagnostic value of subsequent laparoscopy (LSC). The infertile couples (N = 132) were aged 29 +/- 0.5 SD years, with 3.2 +/- 0.4 years of infertility, and were followed for an average of 17 +/- 1.5 months after the HSG. Twenty-nine percent of patients became pregnant after a normal HSG performed with water-soluble contrast medium. There was a fourfold greater rate of pregnancy during the first three months after a normal HSG than during any other three-month interval up to one year. Thirty-four of the initial 132 patients required laparoscopy because of failure to conceive or suspected pelvic disease based on symptoms or the results of a pelvic examination. Among the 34 patients receiving LSC, pelvic pathology was found in 19 (56%). Corrective surgery and/or a change in therapy occurred in 60% of cases after LSC. There was an increased proportion of abnormal findings with increasing time intervals between HSG and LSC but not with increasing intervals of infertility before HSG. Abnormal uterine bleeding was predictive of abnormalities at LSC, while prior use of oral contraceptives correlated negatively with pelvic pathology. In women in infertile couples who have a normal HSG: (1) LSC should not be performed before three months after a normal HSG because of the potential therapeutic effect of HSG, (2) LSC should be performed after a normal HSG if pregnancy has not occurred by at least one year because of the high incidence of pelvic pathology, and (3) HSG using water-soluble contrast media has a therapeutic effect comparable to that described for oil-soluble contrast media.

Sex- and BMI-related differences in risk factors for coronary artery disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. There are contrasting data about the relationship between obesity and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is not known if risk factors for coronary artery disease are different in normal weight and overweight or obese patients. All 2113 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus referring to the Diabetic Clinic of Asti were studied. Patients were divided into tertiles of body mass index, according to their sex (BMI &lt; 26.9; &gt;/= 26.9 and &lt; 31.4; &gt;/= 31.4 kg/m(2) for females and BMI &lt; 25.7; &gt;/= 25.7 and &lt; 28.8; &gt;/= 28.8 kg/m(2) for males). Age, BMI, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, HbA(1c) total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and prevalence of insulin treatment and hypertension were higher in females, whereas exercise, alcohol intake, smoking habits and prevalence of dyslipidemia were higher in males. An increase in BMI was associated with an increase in HbA(1c), number of cigarettes/day, blood pressure, triglycerides, C-peptide, prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and with a decrease in age, duration of diabetes and HDL-cholesterol values. In spite of an apparently worse cardiovascular risk profile, females showed a 50% lower prevalence of CAD than males and the prevalence of CAD was not significantly different in obese compared to other BMI categories. Multiple logistic regression showed that risk factors for CAD were different in males and females and similar in the lower tertiles of BMI, while different in the highest. In obese females, risk factors for CAD were age, reduced HDL-cholesterol and increased HbA(1c) levels; in males they were years of smoking and duration of diabetes. These data suggest that in type 2 diabetes, risk factors for CAD are different in the two sexes and in patients with the highest BMI compared to the normal and overweight subjects; blood glucose control and duration of diabetes seem more important than conventional cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients.

Relationship between diabetes mellitus and degree of coronary artery disease in uraemic patients investigated with coronary angiography. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease is high in diabetic patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT); therefore we examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Twenty-five patients underwent coronary angiography, 12 were awaiting kidney transplantation and the examination was performed regardless of cardiac symptoms, 13 were affected by ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Diabetic and nondiabetic status together with the other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as age, sex, length of time on RRT, smoking and elevated phosphorus levels history, clinical diagnosis of IHD, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, mean blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphate, albumin, haemoglobin, haematocrit and weekly dose of erythropoietin were derived from clinical records. All investigated parameters were matched in diabetic (group 1, n=10) and nondiabetic patients (group 2, n=15) and showed no differences. Clinical evidence of IHD was detected in 80% of patients in group 1 and 46% in group 2 and the percentage of patients on the renal transplant waiting list was not statistically different in the two groups (30 vs 60%). In 60% of patients in group 1 there were 3 or more stenotic lesions equal or greater than 75% of normal reference segment in the major coronary arteries, whilst in 53% in group 2 there were no haemodynamically significant narrowings. Narrowing percentage of the coronaries in group 1 and 2 were: right coronary artery 83 +/- 30 vs 32 +/- 41 (p&lt;0.05), left anterior descending artery 80 +/- 25 vs 44 +/- 34 (p&lt;0.05), left circumflex artery 46 +/- 37 vs 18 +/- 29 (p=0.05) respectively. Our study confirms that IHD is a clinical feature of uraemic diabetic patients and that diabetes is the main cardiovascular risk factor for determining the degree of coronary stenosis.

A 44-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and OSA reported progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion over a 6-week period. Outpatient CT angiogram revealed a pulmonary artery filling defect. He was sent to the ED where he was started on a heparin drip for unprovoked pulmonary embolism (PE). Echocardiogram revealed normal cardiac function without evidence of right heart strain. Lower extremity ultrasound was negative for DVT. He improved symptomatically, and no risk factors for PE were identified. He was discharged on apixaban. Five weeks later, the patient returned to the ED with hemoptysis. He reported compliance with anticoagulation and improvement of his dyspnea on exertion. History remained negative for recent travel, trauma, surgery, clotting disorders, thromboembolic disease, and alcohol or drug use. He had a 60 pack-year cigarette smoking history and quit 3Â months prior.

A prediction score for significant coronary artery disease in Chinese patients â¥50 years old referred for rheumatic valvular heart disease surgery. Our goal was to establish a prediction score and protocol for the preoperative prediction of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we validated the model based on 490 patients without a history of myocardial infarction and who underwent preoperative screening coronary angiography. Significant CAD was defined asââ¥50% narrowing of the diameter of the lumen of the left main coronary artery orââ¥70% narrowing of the diameter of the lumen of the left anterior descending coronary artery, left circumflex artery or right coronary artery. Significant CAD was present in 9.8% of patients. Age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ischaemia evident on an electrocardiogram were independently associated with significant CAD and were entered into the multivariate model. According to the logistic regression predictive risk score, preoperative coronary angiography is recommended in (i) postmenopausal women between 50 and 59âyears of age with â¥9.1% logistic regression predictive risk score; (ii) postmenopausal women who are â¥60âyears old with a logistic regression predictive risk score â¥6.6% and (iii) men â¥50âyears old whose logistic regression predictive risk score was â¥2.8%. Based on this predictive model, 246 (50.2%) preoperative coronary angiograms could be safely avoided. The negative predictive value of the model was 98.8% (246 of 249). This model was accurate for the preoperative prediction of significant CAD in patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease. This model must be validated in larger cohorts and various populations.

In spite of an apparently worse cardiovascular risk profile, females showed a 50% lower prevalence of CAD than males and the prevalence of CAD was not significantly different in obese compared to other BMI categories. Multiple logistic regression showed that risk factors for CAD were different in males and females and similar in the lower tertiles of BMI, while different in the highest. In obese females, risk factors for CAD were age, reduced HDL-cholesterol and increased HbA(1c) levels; in males they were years of smoking and duration of diabetes. These data suggest that in type 2 diabetes, risk factors for CAD are different in the two sexes and in patients with the highest BMI compared to the normal and overweight subjects; blood glucose control and duration of diabetes seem more important than conventional cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients.


[What may cause diabetes]. The case study describes a case of 49-year-old man with morbid obesity since childhood (BMI 40 kg/m2), arterial hypertension (approx. since aged 15, treated since 2004), dyslipidemia (since 2006), type 2 diabetes mellitus (since 2006, on insulin therapy since 2008) and smoking (until 2011, 20 cigarettes a day). 16 types of medication, 8 for hypertension, statin, therapy for diabetes, aspirin, allopurinol. In 2010 (when aged 45) hospitalized in our clinic with dyspnoea and chest pain with a high pressure reading of 180/110 mm Hg (identified symptoms of heart failure with LV ejection fraction of 33 %, in NYHA II functional class, echocardiographically: left atrium: 46 mm, left ventricular chamber size in diastole: 70 mm, interventricular septum: 12 mm, septal hypokinesis, Doppler ultrasonography of lower limb arteries (calcification, diffuse atherosclerotic changes, absent stenosis), CT coronary angiography (significant stenosis of the left coronary artery). Treatment started with 40 mg oral dose of furosemide daily. In May 2011 he was hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome: acute NSTEMI of the inferior wall (coronarography: 2-vascular problems, implemented PKI, implanted DES - ramus circumflexus, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NYHA III functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction: 30 %, pulmonary hypertension). In 2012 renal denervation for resistant hypertension was carried out, carotid stent implanted for stenosis of the carotid artery, presence of diabetic nephropathy (KDOQI stage 3, GF 40 ml/min). In August 2014 admitted to our clinic with pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock, acute ischemia of the right calf with peripheral embolisation, presence of atrial flutter, impairment of renal parameters, echocardiographically: left atrium: 55 mm, left ventricle size: 75 mm, akinesis of the septum and posterior wall, occlusion of the right leg arteries (given the patients serious state angio-surgical intervention was contraindicated, vitally indicated leg amputation considered), the patient died after 4 days of hospitalization in an intensive care unit after unsuccessful treatment. A combination of diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart disease is frequent and prognostically serious. Diabetes increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and therefore we should check for diabetes in all cardiovascular patients.


Relationship between diabetes mellitus and degree of coronary artery disease in uraemic patients investigated with coronary angiography. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease is high in diabetic patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT); therefore we examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Twenty-five patients underwent coronary angiography, 12 were awaiting kidney transplantation and the examination was performed regardless of cardiac symptoms, 13 were affected by ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Diabetic and nondiabetic status together with the other risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as age, sex, length of time on RRT, smoking and elevated phosphorus levels history, clinical diagnosis of IHD, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease, mean blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphate, albumin, haemoglobin, haematocrit and weekly dose of erythropoietin were derived from clinical records. All investigated parameters were matched in diabetic (group 1, n=10) and nondiabetic patients (group 2, n=15) and showed no differences. Clinical evidence of IHD was detected in 80% of patients in group 1 and 46% in group 2 and the percentage of patients on the renal transplant waiting list was not statistically different in the two groups (30 vs 60%). In 60% of patients in group 1 there were 3 or more stenotic lesions equal or greater than 75% of normal reference segment in the major coronary arteries, whilst in 53% in group 2 there were no haemodynamically significant narrowings. Narrowing percentage of the coronaries in group 1 and 2 were: right coronary artery 83 +/- 30 vs 32 +/- 41 (p&lt;0.05), left anterior descending artery 80 +/- 25 vs 44 +/- 34 (p&lt;0.05), left circumflex artery 46 +/- 37 vs 18 +/- 29 (p=0.05) respectively. Our study confirms that IHD is a clinical feature of uraemic diabetic patients and that diabetes is the main cardiovascular risk factor for determining the degree of coronary stenosis.

To present an unusual type of penetrating objects causing Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome (BSS) and its clinical character. Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, PR China. A 54-year-old man fell from a height of 4 m onto an iron fence, and a sharp iron fence point penetrated the right side of his back. He developed left-sided BSS. Both X-ray film and computed tomography scanning of the thoracic spine showed a right vertebral plate of Th5 fracture and metal fragments inclining through the posterior and left lateral of the spinal canal. Emergency decompressive laminectomy and removal of the foreign metal piece were performed. No improvement in neurological function was observed 10 days after surgery, and thus hyperbaric oxygen treatment was initiated twice a day for the next 1 month. Forty days after surgery, his bladder function returned to normal. The motor deficit had regressed and he could walk without assistance 70 days after the operation. One year later, his lower extremity functions recovered almost completely, except for slight numbness on the right side. As far as we know, on the basis of existing literature, the injury mechanism to BSS by a sharp iron fence point has not been reported so far. The satisfactory recovery after injury may in part be attributed to timely surgery and continuing hyperbaric oxygen treatment.

An unusual case of orbito-frontal rod fence stab injury with a good outcome. High-energy non-missile penetrating injuries (stab injuries) account for a small percentage of penetrating head injuries and they present a series of special features. A 35-year-old man suffered orbito-frontal? and trans-cranial injuries after falling five meters from a terrace onto a rod iron fence. The removal of the metal rod was performed outside the operating room. The orbital roof was exposed and repaired through a bifrontal craniotomy and the frontal sinuses were cranialised. The orbital floor and zygoma were plated with micro-screws. The patient recovered without significant complications, apart from a slight paresis of the right superior rectus; the ocular globe remained intact.The positive outcome obtained in this very challenging case is attributable to the competency of the Neurotrauma Unit and to the use of a synergistic approach which involved the contribution of neurosurgeons, maxillo-facial surgeons, radiologists and anaesthesiologists.

Acute Thromboembolism from Trauma in a Patient with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. A 64-year-old man with a history of a 5.5-centimeter (cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe back pain after climbing over a fence and falling a distance of eight feet. Prior to arrival, the prehospital paramedics reported that the patient did not have palpable pulses in either lower extremity. The initial physical examination in the ED was significant for absent dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally as well as absent posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally and cold, insensate lower extremities. Point-of-care ultrasound identified an approximate 7-cm infrarenal AAA with a mural thrombus present. After receiving several computed tomography (CT) studies including CT head without contrast and CT angiography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, the patient was diagnosed with acute thrombosis of AAA and associated thromboembolic occlusion of both his right and left distal iliac vessels causing bilateral acute limb ischemia. He immediately received unfractionated heparin and was admitted to the hospital for embolectomy and intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator. Acute thrombosis of AAA and subsequent thromboembolic events are a rare but significant complication that can occur in patients with a history of AAA. Thromboembolic events may occur spontaneously or in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma. Common presenting signs and symptoms include distal limb ischemia and absent femoral pulses. Timely management and recognition of this rare complication is vital as this condition can ultimately result in limb loss or death if not treated in a timely manner. Heparinization after confirmation of non-ruptured AAA as well as vascular surgery, and therapeutic and vascular interventional radiology consultations are key steps that should be taken to decrease patient morbidity and mortality.

Traumatic hand injuries: the emergency clinician's evidence-based approach. At the start of your Saturday afternoon shift, you are not surprised to see that several patients are waiting to be seen for physical injuries. The first patient is a 34-year-old woman who sustained injury to her hand while skiing, 2 hours prior to her arrival. She reports falling with her hand still tethered to the pole's grip, landing on her outstretched right hand. She felt a painful snap in her right thumb, which still hurts, but otherwise she did not sustain any other trauma. Her only complaint currently is pain at the base of the right thumb. The patient is otherwise completely healthy, has no past medical or surgical history, and takes no medications. Upon examination, the affected hand appears to be surprisingly normal except for mild tenderness and swelling over the ulnar aspect of her first metacarpophalangeal joint and mildly decreased strength in her pincher grasp. X-ray reveals no fracture. You wonder if there is additional testing that should be done to evaluate this injury. You move on to a second patient, a 24-year-old man who cut his ring finger knuckle when he punched a wall 2 days ago. Physical examination reveals a small puncture wound over the IV metacarpophalangeal joint with mild swelling, erythema, warmth, and decreased range of motion secondary to pain. X-ray reveals no fracture, but there's something suspicious about this case. A third patient is a 37-year-old industrial worker whose finger contacted the stream of a high-powered grease injector. Physical examination reveals a small puncture wound over the volar proximal interphalangeal joint of his left long finger, mild tenderness to palpation over the area, and slight decreased range of motion secondary to pain. You wonder if the injury is as benign as it looks.

Emergency bedside sonographic diagnosis of subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm with brachial plexopathy after clavicle fracture. Clavicle fractures are common; however, complications are unusual. Two such complications, subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm and brachial plexopathy, are rare events that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. We report the case of a 53-year-old man who presented with shoulder swelling and right arm weakness for 1 week. Three weeks before, he had fallen and fractured his right clavicle. On presentation to our emergency department, his examination revealed a brachial plexopathy and a large supraclavicular mass. An emergency bedside triplex sonogram was performed to characterize the mass and revealed a swirling pattern within a fluid collection anterior to the subclavian artery, suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm. After computed tomography-angiography, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent hematoma washout and subclavian artery stent-graft placement. This case illustrates how bedside point-of-care sonography can rapidly assist in the initial assessment of subclavian artery injury.

Pseudo-blue lunula and beyond: a normal variant. A 12-hour-old newborn was noted by his parents and primary care team to have distinctive blue nail color changes. The blue color extended from the proximal nail bed to the mid-nail bed region. This did not resolve over the next 2 days, and dermatology was consulted. The child was born full term, and he and his mother had no medical history. He had an Apgar score of 9, and regular pulse oximeter showed &gt; 97% saturation. No signs of cyanosis were noted on full skin and mucosa examination. Complete blood cell count and basic metabolic panel results were unremarkable. The blue discoloration (Figure) was not blanchable and did not resolve with warming of the hands. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable and no murmur was appreciated. Due to the lack of physical or laboratory alterations, observation was recommended as the best approach. On discharge, the blue discoloration continued and was still noted by the pediatrician on day 7. The parents eventually noted clearance at 2 weeks.

[Severe respiratory distress due to ileal duplication cyst in the newborn]. Differential diagnosis of neonatal respiratory distress includes pulmonary and systemic disorders and anatomic problems compromising respiratory system. We report on a 2770-g female born to a 29-year-old gravida 3, para 2 woman after 34 weeks of gestation. Antenatal ultrasound performed in week 8 and 21 was normal. The infant was delivered by cesarean section after amniotic membranes had been ruptured for less than 12 hours due to signs of fetal distress. The Apgar score was 3 and 3 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The infant was intubated and resuscitated, and transferred immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit. She had an extremely protuberant and cyanotic abdomen. Dilated cutaneous collateral vessels were apparent in the periumbilical region. Abdominal sonography showed cystic multiloculated tumorous mass filled with dense, flocculent content at the level of hepatic portal. The tumorous mass occupied the majority of the abdomen with caudal extension toward the pelvis and dorsally toward the spine. The liver was displaced high under the diaphragm with the left liver lobe in the left hemiabdomen. On x-ray the lung were collapsed due to a large abdominal mass in the right hemiabdomen that displaced the right diaphragm and intestines contralaterally. She soon developed bilateral pneumothoraces. Drainage and continuous suction were started. The infant failed to improve despite all attempts and died. On autopsy, an extremely large, mobile, multichambered, solitary cyst was found. It was attached to the mesenteric side of the ileum by its own thin peduncular stalk and had no communication with the remainder of the gut. It occupied the majority of the abdomen. Histologic section revealed a well-developed smooth muscle wall and inner mucosa of small bowel type. Respiratory distress is a common problem in premature infants. The majority of cases are due to pulmonary disorders (e. g., hyaline membrane disease, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia), hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and congenital heart disease. Anatomic problems including space occupying lesions are less common. Duplications of the alimentary tract in infants and children are rare congenital anomalies. Although symptoms can occur at any age, they usually present during the first year. In our patient, intraabdominal mass caused severe respiratory distress and respiratory failure in the first hours of postnatal life. This had been seen before only as a complication of intrathoracic lesions extending into the abdominal cavity. Pathology revealed spherical intestinal duplication that was completely separated from the alimentary tract. Embryologically, it was a localized duplication. Respiratory distress in our patient was refractory to all means of mechanical ventilation. Poor lung compliance was the consequence of prenatal lung hypoplasia and inadequate postnatal lung expansion due to the duplication cyst space occupying character and its compressive effect. Prenatal diagnosis was the child's only chance for survival but it was not made. Duplications of the alimentary tract can present a diagnostic challenge even in the first hours of life. They should be included in the differential diagnosis of severe respiratory distress, especially in premature infants in which timely prenatal diagnosis cannot be always made. We propose their inclusion among other space occupying lesions that might be the cause of severe respiratory distress even in the earliest neonatal period.

Culture clash: a missed opportunity. Erasto is a term infant born by vaginal delivery to a gravida 7 para 7 Somalia woman with full prenatal care in the United States. His mother had gestational diabetes. The delivery was complicated by respiratory distress and an urgent admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for further evaluation for possible pulmonary disease and a congenital heart condition. A female pediatric intern was assigned to update Erasto's mother on the baby's status and to obtain consent for an intravascular line placement. When she entered the room to talk to the mother, multiple family members spanning at 3 generations were with the baby's mother. They were all women with the exception of Erasto's father who was apprised of the baby's clinical status by the male neonatal physician several minutes earlier. Through a telephone translator, the intern explained to Erasto's mother that her baby may have heart and lung problems that may be related to her gestational diabetes. At this point, many family members spoke simultaneously and excitedly. Some accused the intern of keeping the baby in the neonatal intensive care unit "to make more money," and others said they would sue her "if anything happened to Erasto." The mother denied that she had gestational diabetes, and claimed that because she "believed in God...nothing is wrong with my baby." The intern was not prepared for this response and asked herself, "What went wrong?"

Transient neonatal methemoglobinemia caused by maternal pudendal anesthesia in delivery with prilocaine: report of two cases. This paper reports two cases of transient neonatal methemoglobinemia caused by maternal pudendal anesthesia with prilocaine. In the first case a two-hour-old, 3100 gram term-male infant was admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) because of central cyanosis. He was born from a 21-year-old mother with spontaneous vaginal delivery. Central cyanosis was noted without respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation was recorded as 72% with pulse oximetry in room air and with oxygen given by mask. Chest radiogram, echocardiography and laboratory findings were found to be normal except a methemoglobin level of 28%. No etiology was found, except for maternal prilocaine administration during labor. In the second case a six-hour-old 3300 gram, full-term male neonate born by spontaneous vaginal delivery was admitted to NICU for central cyanosis. The neonate was noted to have central cyanosis with respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry was 70% with mask oxygen therapy. Methemoglobin level was 42%. The neonate was treated with single dose intravenous ascorbic acid (300 mg/kg) to which he responded dramatically at 24 hours of life. No other etiology was detected except pudendal anesthesia during delivery with prilocaine. According to the authors, prilocaine administered before delivery to provide maternal local pudendal anesthesia may cause transient neonatal methemoglobinemia. All neonates born to mothers who receive potential oxidant drugs like prilocaine just before the time of delivery should be carefully monitored for methemoglobinemia.

The DiGeorge anomaly (CATCH 22, DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome). The DiGeorge anomaly (DGA), originally considered a clinical paradigm for isolated thymus deficiency, has now been redefined as a member of a group of disorders that share in common a chromosome deletion, which results in monosomy 22q11 (CATCH-22 or DiGeorge/velocardiofacial [VCFS] syndrome). In addition to the thymus defect, conotruncal heart anomalies, dysmorphism, hypoparathyroidism, and cleft palate are prominent features. Despite the emphasis on thymus involvement in DGA, a clinically significant thymus defect is found only in a small percentage of these patients. The basic embryological fault in these disorders is an inadequate development of the facial neural crest tissues, resulting in defective organogenesis of pharyngeal pouch derivatives. Although first described by an endocrinologist, this experiment of nature has become a major subject of investigation for geneticists and immunologists. Elucidation of the etiology and attempts to effectively treat the diverse clinical problems continue to challenge and stimulate many disciplines of medicine both in the laboratory and at the bedside.

[Congenital cardiovascular malformations and chromosome microdeletions in 22q11.2]. Congenital cardiovascular (c-v) malformations are the leading signs of two syndromes of highly variable phenotypes, the DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and the velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), both of which in the majority of cases are caused by microdeletion in the chromosome region 22q11.2. It was the aim of this study to ascertain the frequency of these chromosomal abnormalities in patients with unselected congenital cardiovascular malformation, and to assess the type of c-v malformation for which microdeletion analysis of the mentioned region would be indicated. The cohort consisted of 90 patients with congenital c-v malformations (35 males, 55 females; mean age 3.6 years (19th week of pregnancy-36 years). Most of them were newborns. The c-v anomalies were: ventricular septal defect (n = 20), pulmonary atresia (10), Fallot's tetralogy (9), truncus arteriosus communis (6), aortic valve stenosis (6), atrioventricular canal (6), type B interrupted aortic arch (5), atrial septal defect (5), tricuspid atresia (4), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (4), persisting ductus arteriosus (3), pulmonary valve stenosis (3), complete (third degree) atrioventricular block (2), Ebstein's anomaly (1), tachycardia (1) and enlarged right atrium (1). Four of 14 fetuses included in this study had complex cardiac anomalies that could not be definitively classified. Cytogenetic karyotype analysis was unremarkable in all cases. Microdeletion detection was done by fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH). 14 of the 90 cases (about 16%) showed microdeletion in the examined chromosomal region 22q11.2. Among the group with microdeletion were aortic arch interruption (5/5), ventricular septal defect (2/20). Fallot's tetralogy (1/9) and atrial septal defect (1/5). All the deletion carriers had other signs of the DGS/VCFS complex. One parent each in two of the microdeletion patients had the same microdeletions. In patients with congenital c-v and associated malformations of dysmorphism microdeletion diagnosis of 22q11.2 by FISH is indicated in addition to conventional cytogenetic testing. The incidence of this microdeletion seems to be especially high among patients with type B interrupted aortic arch.

Clinical variability of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is a disorder that has multiple symptoms and affects various organs and systems. Despite the great variability of clinical manifestations, common 22q11.2 DS includes congenital heart defect, immunodeficiency, characteristic facial features, palatal defects, developmental and/or learning disabilities, and hypocalcaemia. We present the cases of three patients with 22q11.2 DS that we have observed. Heart defects were revealed in all cases, and tetralogy of Fallot in one of them. Immune system disorders in these cases were highly variable and did not correlate with aplasia or hypoplasia of the thymus. Cleft palate was diagnosed only in one case. Characteristic facial features were presented in all cases but they were not significant and varied from subtle to mild. Developmental disability was presented by motor delays in two cases. Hypocalcaemia was revealed in one patient, and seizures were absent. Only one case completely fit CATCH-22 syndrome (cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcaemia caused by22q11.2 deletion). The other cases had three out of the five main features, with some other, less significant signs also presented. In some cases, even just a few signs should be the reason for further examination to exclude 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Currently, immunological disorders are not a significant determinant in the diagnosis of this syndrome, and timely correction of heart defects can reduce the number of recurrent respiratory infections. A multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients and providing timely, complex medical care will prevent serious complications.

FISH investigation of 22q11.2 deletion in patients with immunodeficiency and/or cardiac abnormalities. DiGeorge anomaly/velocardiofacial syndrome (DG/VCFS), called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in general, is the most common chromosomal deletion syndrome found in humans. Typical facial features, palatal defects, conotruncal abnormalities of the heart, aplasia/hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands and of thymus are characteristics of this syndrome. Deletions of chromosome 22q11.2 (del22q11.2) are the leading causes of DG7VCFS. We report on a systematic search by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for deletions of chromosomes 22q11.2 in patients with a clinical suspicion or diagnosis of DG/VCFS. Using FISH we studied a series of 43 patients with suspected DG/VCFS. In this study, a total of 43 patients were investigated for the presence of a 22q11.2 deletion over a two-year period. Del22q11.2 was detected in 5 of the 43 patients tested. All patients with deletion had hypocalcemia, 80% had cardiac defects, 40% had facial dysmorphism, 40% had immunodeficiency , and 20% had otolaryngeal abnormalities. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion is a relatively common condition and is readily diagnosed by FISH. We suggest that FISH analysis of 22q11.2 deletion should be performed in the presence of combined of hypocalcemia and congenital cardiac malformations, with or without any characteristics of the disease. This may facilitate an early diagnosis in such patients.

Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome: the first three cases reported in Thailand. The DiGeorge, velocardiofacial, and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes were originally described as separate disorders due to different concerns regarding phenotypes. However, all these disorders have some common clinical manifestations, including congenital heart defect, facial anomaly, and developmental delay. It is now clear that most cases of these syndromes have a common cause resulting from microdeletion of chromosome 22q11. This study reports the first three cases of Thai children presented with developmental delays. All are females who were known cases of congenital heart diseases. Their minor facial anomalies were subtle and not previously recognized as of any syndromes. The chromosome study by fluorescent in situ hybridization technique yielded microdeletion of chromosome 22q11. Without known prevalence in Asian populations, except in Japanese children, further study for chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome in Asian children with conotruncal heart defects, who also have minor facial anomalies or developmental delays, should be undertaken.

The DiGeorge anomaly (CATCH 22, DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome). The DiGeorge anomaly (DGA), originally considered a clinical paradigm for isolated thymus deficiency, has now been redefined as a member of a group of disorders that share in common a chromosome deletion, which results in monosomy 22q11 (CATCH-22 or DiGeorge/velocardiofacial [VCFS] syndrome). In addition to the thymus defect, conotruncal heart anomalies, dysmorphism, hypoparathyroidism, and cleft palate are prominent features. Despite the emphasis on thymus involvement in DGA, a clinically significant thymus defect is found only in a small percentage of these patients. The basic embryological fault in these disorders is an inadequate development of the facial neural crest tissues, resulting in defective organogenesis of pharyngeal pouch derivatives. Although first described by an endocrinologist, this experiment of nature has become a major subject of investigation for geneticists and immunologists. Elucidation of the etiology and attempts to effectively treat the diverse clinical problems continue to challenge and stimulate many disciplines of medicine both in the laboratory and at the bedside.

Spontaneous Hemoptysis in a Patient With COVID-19. A 65-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, gradually worsening for the previous 2Â weeks, associated with dry cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any sick contacts or travel history outside of Michigan. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. He was taking amiodarone, carvedilol, furosemide, pregabalin, and insulin. The patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. He was afebrile and had saturation at 93%Â on 3Â L of oxygen, heart rate of 105 beats/min, BP of 145/99Â mmÂ Hg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. On auscultation, there were crackles on bilateral lung bases and chronic bilateral leg swelling with hyperpigmented changes. His WBC count was 6.0 K/cumm (3.5 to 10.6 K/cumm) with absolute lymphocyte count 0.7 K/cumm (1.0 to 3.8 K/cumm); serum creatinine was 2.81Â mg/dL (0.7 to 1.3Â mg/dL). He had elevated inflammatory markers (serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and creatinine phosphokinase). Chest radiography showed bilateral pulmonary opacities that were suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Fig 1). Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Therapy was started with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone 1Â mg/kg IV for 3Â days. By day 3 of hospitalization, he required endotracheal intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement. Blood cultures were negative; respiratory cultures revealed only normal oral flora, so antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 10, WBC count increased to 28 K/cumm, and chest radiography showed persistent bilateral opacities with left lower lobe consolidation. Repeat respiratory cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa (TableÂ 1). Antibiotic therapy with IV meropenem was started. His condition steadily improved; eventually by day 20, he was off vasopressors and was extubated. However, on day 23, he experienced significant hemoptysis that required reintubation and vasopressor support.

[Fulminant, life-threatening influenza A/H1N1 virus infection]. A 52-year-old man presented with unproductive cough, fever and chill in our emergency department. Self-medication with amoxicillin over 3 days failed to improve his condition. The patient was in poor general condition. His body temperature was 38.4 C, with a heart rate of 124/min, a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and a positive shock index. At auscultation of the chest fine rales were heard over both lungs with diminished percussion sounds basal. The respiratory rate was 30/min and the oxygen saturation of 84% at room air. Laboratory: signs of inflammation; blood gas analysis: pronounced hypoxemia. A chest radiogram revealed signs of extensive pulmonary infiltrates on both sides. The patient was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit. He received piperacillin, sulbactam and levoflaxacin, ample fluid and non-invasive ventilation as well as intermittent catecholamine treatment. As there was no clinical improvement the patient was intubated on day 3. On bronchoscopy viral etiology was suspected. At this time the respiratory situation deteriorated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed. An antifungal and antiviral treatment (voriconazol, oseltamivir) was started and a cortisone pulse was attempted. The patient was transferred to another clinic where extracorporeal membranoxygenation (ECMO) was performed on the same day. The following day influenza A/H1N1-test was confirmed. Ten days after transfer, the patient regained spontaneous respiration, and he most likely survives the infection. The incidence of influenza (A/H1N1) has increased in Germany and severe and lethal courses have occurred. Therefore, the diagnostic and treatment algorithms need to be reconsidered in order to rapidly diagnose and treat infections.

Spontaneous Hemoptysis in a Patient With COVID-19. A 65-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, gradually worsening for the previous 2Â weeks, associated with dry cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any sick contacts or travel history outside of Michigan. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. He was taking amiodarone, carvedilol, furosemide, pregabalin, and insulin. The patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. He was afebrile and had saturation at 93%Â on 3Â L of oxygen, heart rate of 105 beats/min, BP of 145/99Â mmÂ Hg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. On auscultation, there were crackles on bilateral lung bases and chronic bilateral leg swelling with hyperpigmented changes. His WBC count was 6.0 K/cumm (3.5 to 10.6 K/cumm) with absolute lymphocyte count 0.7 K/cumm (1.0 to 3.8 K/cumm); serum creatinine was 2.81Â mg/dL (0.7 to 1.3Â mg/dL). He had elevated inflammatory markers (serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and creatinine phosphokinase). Chest radiography showed bilateral pulmonary opacities that were suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Fig 1). Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Therapy was started with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone 1Â mg/kg IV for 3Â days. By day 3 of hospitalization, he required endotracheal intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement. Blood cultures were negative; respiratory cultures revealed only normal oral flora, so antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 10, WBC count increased to 28 K/cumm, and chest radiography showed persistent bilateral opacities with left lower lobe consolidation. Repeat respiratory cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa (TableÂ 1). Antibiotic therapy with IV meropenem was started. His condition steadily improved; eventually by day 20, he was off vasopressors and was extubated. However, on day 23, he experienced significant hemoptysis that required reintubation and vasopressor support.


Dyspnea in a 57-Year-Old Man With Recent Viral Illness. A 57-year-old man presented to the ED with a 1-month history of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2Â months before presentation, when he experienced an episode of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed clinically with an upper respiratory tract infection; the symptoms resolved after 7Â days with conservative therapy alone. One month later, the nonproductive cough and shortness of breath returned. He was treated with a 5-day course of oral azithromycin without any improvement in his symptoms. On presentation to the ED, he denied fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, arthralgia, myalgia, or hemoptysis. His medical history was significant for hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery bypass grafting. His medications included aspirin, metoprolol, metformin, and glipizide. He denied any history of tobacco, vaping, or recreational drug use. He worked as a cashier in a departmental store and has been doing so for most of his life.

[Fulminant, life-threatening influenza A/H1N1 virus infection]. A 52-year-old man presented with unproductive cough, fever and chill in our emergency department. Self-medication with amoxicillin over 3 days failed to improve his condition. The patient was in poor general condition. His body temperature was 38.4 C, with a heart rate of 124/min, a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg and a positive shock index. At auscultation of the chest fine rales were heard over both lungs with diminished percussion sounds basal. The respiratory rate was 30/min and the oxygen saturation of 84% at room air. Laboratory: signs of inflammation; blood gas analysis: pronounced hypoxemia. A chest radiogram revealed signs of extensive pulmonary infiltrates on both sides. The patient was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit. He received piperacillin, sulbactam and levoflaxacin, ample fluid and non-invasive ventilation as well as intermittent catecholamine treatment. As there was no clinical improvement the patient was intubated on day 3. On bronchoscopy viral etiology was suspected. At this time the respiratory situation deteriorated. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed. An antifungal and antiviral treatment (voriconazol, oseltamivir) was started and a cortisone pulse was attempted. The patient was transferred to another clinic where extracorporeal membranoxygenation (ECMO) was performed on the same day. The following day influenza A/H1N1-test was confirmed. Ten days after transfer, the patient regained spontaneous respiration, and he most likely survives the infection. The incidence of influenza (A/H1N1) has increased in Germany and severe and lethal courses have occurred. Therefore, the diagnostic and treatment algorithms need to be reconsidered in order to rapidly diagnose and treat infections.

This male infant was born to a 19-year-old, gravida 1, para 0, woman who received routine prenatal check-up. Polyhydramnios, low-lying ears, and proboscis were noted by sonography at 29 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis showed a normal karyotype of 46, XY. Premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor were noted at 32 weeks of gestation. A male infant was delivered preterm and died shortly after birth. The infant showed midline proboscis and absence of mandible. The simple, soft ears were extremely low-set and were near the midline of the neck. Otocephaly is regarded as the most severe form of first arch anomalies. Prenatal diagnosis should be dependent on ultrasound analysis. In the face of polyhydramnios, otocephaly is one of the possible fetal anomalies.

Asymptomatic uterine rupture of a cornual pregnancy in the third trimester: a case report. Reports of cornual pregnancy persisting until fetal viability and of ultrasound diagnosis of asymptomatic uterine rupture are rare. A 24-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 5, presented for initial ultrasound evaluation at 28 5/7 weeks' gestation after registering late for prenatal care. Her history included 2 prior cesarean deliveries. Obstetric ultrasound evaluation revealed a clinically silent uterine rupture with a live fetus. The site of rupture was suspected to be the prior uterine scar. After completion of a course of antenatal corticosteroids, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, abdominal delivery of a live, male neonate, hysterectomy and appendectomy. The patient experienced an unremarkable postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 4. The infant was discharged on hospital day 83 with chronic lung disease, stage 1 retinopathy of prematurity, atrial septal defect and a right clubfoot; there were no additional findings at the 4-month follow-up. Pathologic examination demonstrated cornual implantation with subsequent uterine rupture. This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a suspicion for ectopic pregnancy at advanced gestational ages and for uterine rupture even in the absence of symptoms. The case also illustrates that fetal survival can occur in cornual pregnancy.

[A 54-year-old man with progressive proximal muscle atrophy and gynecomastia]. We report a 54-year-old man with progressive proximal muscle atrophy and gynecomastia. The patient had an insidious onset of weakness in his lower extremities at age 14, in that he noted a difficulty in standing up from a chair. Soon after he noted some difficulty in climbing up stairs. At age 35, he noted weakness in his arms; his weakness slowly progressed in that he became unable to walk or stand alone before 40 years of age. He also noted gynecomastia at that age. He was admitted to our hospital for the work up on September 16, 1993, when he was 54-year-old. On admission, he was alert and oriented; his BP was 150/70 mmHg; he had bilateral gynecomastia, however, no other skeletal deformities were found. On neurologic examination, he was mentally sound without dementia, and his higher cerebral functions were normal. Cranial nerves also appeared intact without facial atrophy, dysarthria, or dysphagia; no atrophy was noted in the tongue. He had marked muscle atrophy in both upper and lower extremities more marked in the proximal portions; muscle strength was approximately in the range of 2/5 to 3/5 in the proximal parts, and 4/5 in the distal parts in both upper and lower extremities. No fasciculation was noted; muscle tone was flaccid; no ataxia was present. Deep reflexes were either lost or markedly diminished. No Babinski sign was noted. Sensation was intact. Laboratory examination revealed normal blood counts; serum CK was slightly increased to 131 IU/l; ECG showed complete right bundle branch block; EMG revealed no active units in the right biceps brachii, deltoid, quadriceps femoris, and triceps surae muscles; in other muscles tested, motor unit potentials of low amplitude and short duration were seen; in the right tibialis anterior muscle, however, motor unit potentials with an amplitude up to 6 m V were also seen. Nerve conduction velocities were normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed. He was discussed in the neurological CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that this patient had Becker type of progressive muscular dystrophy. In her differential diagnosis, the possibility of Kennedy-Alter-Sung syndrome was discussed because this patient had gynecomastia. However, the discussant excluded that possibility because of absence of both bulbar symptoms and typical neurogenic changes in his EMG. The diagnostic procedure was a muscle biopsy on the left tibialis anterior muscle. Histologic observation on HE stained specimens revealed marked inequality in the muscle fiber diameters, increase in endomysial nuclei, proliferation of connective tissue, and fiber splitting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Progressive kyphotic deformity in comminuted burst fractures treated non-operatively: the Achilles tendon of the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS). The Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity (TLICS) scale has been considered one of the best available grading systems for evaluating thoracolumbar fractures, especially due to the fact that, differently from previous classifications, it can be used as a practical algorithm to orient the clinical decision-making between conservative and surgical management. The authors describe a case of a 54-year-old patient presenting with low-back pain after having struck her back on the handrail. The neurological exam was unremarkable. The CT-scan of the lumbar spine demonstrated a L1 comminuted burst fracture. The MRI demonstrated no evidence of posterior ligamentous complex injury. According to the TLICS classification (total score of 2) the patient was managed conservatively with a thoracolumbar brace. Although at the 1-month follow-up the X-rays demonstrated no major changes and the pain had clinically improved, the patient was lost to follow-up. After 12 months the patient presented back to the emergency department with complaints of increased back pain. The repeat CT-scan demonstrated a remarkable worsening of the vertebral body fracture, with a major kyphotic deformity. The patient was submitted to a staged anterior-posterior procedure consisting in posterior decompression of the T12-L2 levels, a T10-L4 pedicle screw fixation and, finally, a lateral transpsoas approach for L1 corpectomy and reconstruction with an expandable interbody cage and plate fixation. At the 6-months follow-up, the patient presented another episode of back pain and a new L4 endplate fracture was identified. After 2 months of failed conservative treatment, the patient was treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty. At the 12-months follow-up after the initial surgical procedure, the patient was pain free and with stable radiographs. In this Grand Rounds presentation, the authors perform a comprehensive discussion about the historical developments in the classification systems for thoracolumbar fractures with special emphasis in the new TLICS system. Although such score presents several advantages in relation to other grading systems, patients with comminuted burst fractures deserve special attention, even if initially classified as non-operative according to the TLICS algorithm. In such cases, if a decision of conservative management is taken, a close follow-up is recommended due to the high likelihood of long-term kyphotic deformity.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke. A 49 year-old man with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement in the right coronary artery in 2010 presented for evaluation of left hemiplegia. He was feeling well until three hours prior to presentation, at which time he fell while walking from his bedroom into the kitchen. After falling, he noticed that his left upper and lower extremities felt weak. He denied any symptoms preceding the fall or any loss of consciousness. On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

Best treatment strategies in high-risk multiple myeloma: navigating a gray area. A previously healthy 62-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with a 3-month history of fatigue and unremitting back pain. Physical examination revealed mucosal pallor, point tenderness at T10-T12, and a normal neurologic examination with preserved lower extremity strength and sphincter tone. Laboratory work-up disclosed hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume of 101 fL and otherwise normal blood cell counts; reticulocytes, 0.98%; stable creatinine, 1.1 mg/dL; calcium, 9.1 mg/dL; albumin, 3.4 g/dL; Î²2-microglobulin, 5.7 mg/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 397 IU/L; and normal liver function tests. Bone survey showed lytic lesions at T10, T12, and throughout the axial skeleton and osteopenia. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) demonstrated a 3.5 g/dL monoclonal peak in the gamma region, with monoclonal immunoglobulin G and lambda light chain detected on immunofixation. Serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio was 0.0001. Twenty-four-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) was normal. Bone marrow biopsy showed 60% infiltration with lambda light chain-restricted plasma cells staining positive for CD138 and CD56 and negative for CD45 by flow cytometry (Fig 1). Congo red stain on bone marrow biopsy and fat pad aspirate was negative for amyloid light-chain deposition. Cytogenetics of the malignant cells identified a t(4;14) translocation, confirming the diagnosis of high-risk, International Staging System stage III immunoglobulin G lambda multiple myeloma (MM). The patient began treatment with lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) plus monthly intravenous zoledronic acid therapy. He has tolerated therapy well, and the monoclonal protein peak is rapidly declining. He is now referred to discuss indications for autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) and overall prognosis.

[Iron deficiency anemia is not always simple]. Malabsorption of oraliron is rare, and more frequently suspected than proved. It could be due to prolonged iron deficiency. Case no. 1: A boy was admitted at the age of 5 months for recurrent bronchitis. His hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 60 micron3, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 15 ng and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 25 gHb/dl. The serum iron was 1 microgram/dl, iron binding capacity (IBC) was 284 micrograms/dl and ferritin was 14.9 ng/ml. Dietary iron was inadequate. The patient was given ferrous sulfate but iron deficiency persisted at the ages of 11 months and 3 years, probably due to poor compliance. Similar hematologic data (Hb: 6.4 g/dl, MCV 55 micrograms/m3, MCH 13.9 ng, MCHC 24 gHb/dl) were found at the age of 9 years. The patient was then given ferrous sulfate orally as test but the serum iron levels were unchanged during the 4 hours following ingestion. A parenteral iron preparation (iron-dextran, 500 mg) improved the hematologic data. 6 months later, a new oral test with ferrous sulfate improved the serum iron level. Case no. 2: A boy with complex congenital cardiopathy was operated on in the neonatal period and given oral iron at the age of 9 months because of anemia with microcytosis and hypochromia. This anemia was still present at 17 months and was associated with normal or high serum ferritin. Electrophoresis of hemoglobin was normal. At the age of 4 yr 5 mo, Hb was 9.7 g/dl, MCV 62.8 micrograms/m3, MCH 18.4 ng, iron 16 micrograms/dl and ferritin 94.1 ng/ml. An oral test with ferrous sulfate failed to increase the serum iron. The patient was then given parenteral iron-dextran without benefit, and a second oral test remained ineffective. After a second course of parenteral iron-dextran, Hb was 11.5 g/dl, MCV 74.1 micrograms/m3, MCH 23.7 ng while the serum iron remained low (23 micrograms/dl) and ferritin increased to 587 ng/ml. A third oral test with ferrous sulfate was still ineffective, as was a test using 4 mg/kg iron. The first patient suffered from iron malabsorption, presumably due to iron deficiency. The second patient could have abnormal metabolism and/or abnormal ferritin.

A Retrospective Study Using Mentzer Index for Prevalence of Iron Deficiency Anemia among Infants Visiting Maternal Centers at the Age of One Year. Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. Characterizing anemia as microcytic and normocytic depends on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is an important parameter in differentiating many types of anemia. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. In this study, we aimed to assess the Mentzer index used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Palestine as a useful tool in differentiating between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia. We assessed for the prevalence of IDA among infants at the age of one year visiting the mother centers from seven West Bank provinces in Palestine. Medical records and hematology laboratory data of 3262 infants were retrospectively analyzed from the years of 2018 to 2020. The Mentzer index applied to all population by dividing mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microliter). A corrected Mentzer index was further calculated among anemic infants to include only microcytic (MCV with less than 72âfl) and hypochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with less than 32âg/L) indices.

Pattern of milk feeding and family size as risk factors for iron deficiency anemia among poor Egyptian infants 6 to 24 months old. Infants between 6 and 24 months of age are at the highest risk of development of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in developing countries. Consuming unmodified cow's milk, delayed introduction of solid foods after 6 months, and high birth order could be predictors of the presence of IDA. Three hundred infants between the ages of 6 and 24 months (mean, 13.94 Â± 6.17 months) from Ain Shams University Children's Hospital were enrolled in the study. Data collected included demographic information and dietary assessment including the type of milk feeding, introduction of solid foods, and daily iron intake. The infants were examined, and anthropometric measurements were recorded. Anemic infants (hemoglobin level &lt;11 g/dL) were further evaluated by complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and iron profile. Anemia was diagnosed among 198 infants (66%), of whom 129 (43%) had IDA. Red cell distribution width at a cutoff value of 15.8% was 86% sensitive and 74% specific in predicting IDA. The main risk factors for IDA included being between 6 and 18 months of age, of the male sex, birth order above the second order, consuming cow's milk, predominant breast-feeding beyond 6 months of age, and low daily iron intake. We conclude that IDA is the most common cause of anemia among Egyptian infants 6 to 24 months old of low socioeconomic standard. Independent clinical predictors were consuming cow's milk during the first 6 months, delayed introduction of solid foods after 6 months, and birth order beyond the second order.

Severe iron-deficiency anemia still an issue in toddlers. Chronic, severe iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in the first years of life increases the risk of irreversibly compromised cognitive, affective, and motor development. While IDA in infants has decreased because of dietary changes (iron-fortified formula and delaying cow's milk), toddlers (13-36 months) are equally vulnerable to the adverse effects of IDA. We aimed to show that despite public health efforts, severe IDA remains a problem in toddlers and is associated with excess milk consumption. Retrospective chart review of children 6 to 36 months admitted to or evaluated by hematology at a children's hospital from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010 with a severe microcytic anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] &lt;9 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) &lt;75 fL). We identified 68 infants and toddlers with severe IDA; most (84%) were 13 to 36 months old. The mean Hb and MCV were 6.0 g/dL (range = 2.2-8.9 g/dL) and 54.0 fL (range = 45.5-69.8 fL), respectively. Fatigue, poor appetite, and pica were the most common symptoms, found in 43%, 29%, and 22% of patients, respectively. Only 41% of parents reported pale skin while 77% of physicians recorded it on physical exam. Daily cow's milk consumption surpassed 24 ounces for 47 of 48 children with reported intake; 11 consumed more than 64 ounces per day. Despite current screening recommendations, severe IDA continues to be a problem in toddlers and strongly correlates with excess cow's milk consumption. This reiterates the importance of screening for IDA into routine toddler care.

Recognizing missed opportunities to diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia: A study based on prevalence of anemia among children in a teaching hospital. In developing world, anemia is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in children under 5 years of age. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a very important causative factor for childhood anemia. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of anemia in different age group, sex, and its pattern of severity in hospitalized children. A cross-sectional study was carried out in a teaching hospital in Kolkata between April 2016 and September 2016. Children 1-168 months of age were included in the study. Of 697 children, 296 (42.5%) had anemia as per the World Health Organization criteria. Males outnumbered the females with a ratio of 1.6:1. The median age of presentation was 29.6 months. The majority were from 1-5 years of age. About 73.3% of children had moderate anemia, whereas 21.3% had severe anemia and only 5% had mild anemia. The mean hemoglobin, mean mean corpuscular volume, mean mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and mean red cell distribution width were 9.3 Â± 1.4 g/dL, 73.6 Â± 8.8 (fL), 32.2 Â± 2.6, and 16.3 Â± 3.4 (%), respectively. Microcytic hypochromic anemia (71.3%) was the most common morphological type in all age groups, whereas macrocytic anemia was the least common among them. Prevalence of IDA was 69%. IDA was documented in close to 80% of children with microcytic hypochromic anemia. Interestingly, IDA was also documented in almost half of the children with normocytic normochromic anemia. The high prevalence of IDA among these hospitalized children indicates the role of early screening for IDA in all children with anemia. This early diagnosis and prompt management can prevent the mortality and morbidity related to IDA.

[Iron deficiency anemia is not always simple]. Malabsorption of oraliron is rare, and more frequently suspected than proved. It could be due to prolonged iron deficiency. Case no. 1: A boy was admitted at the age of 5 months for recurrent bronchitis. His hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 60 micron3, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 15 ng and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 25 gHb/dl. The serum iron was 1 microgram/dl, iron binding capacity (IBC) was 284 micrograms/dl and ferritin was 14.9 ng/ml. Dietary iron was inadequate. The patient was given ferrous sulfate but iron deficiency persisted at the ages of 11 months and 3 years, probably due to poor compliance. Similar hematologic data (Hb: 6.4 g/dl, MCV 55 micrograms/m3, MCH 13.9 ng, MCHC 24 gHb/dl) were found at the age of 9 years. The patient was then given ferrous sulfate orally as test but the serum iron levels were unchanged during the 4 hours following ingestion. A parenteral iron preparation (iron-dextran, 500 mg) improved the hematologic data. 6 months later, a new oral test with ferrous sulfate improved the serum iron level. Case no. 2: A boy with complex congenital cardiopathy was operated on in the neonatal period and given oral iron at the age of 9 months because of anemia with microcytosis and hypochromia. This anemia was still present at 17 months and was associated with normal or high serum ferritin. Electrophoresis of hemoglobin was normal. At the age of 4 yr 5 mo, Hb was 9.7 g/dl, MCV 62.8 micrograms/m3, MCH 18.4 ng, iron 16 micrograms/dl and ferritin 94.1 ng/ml. An oral test with ferrous sulfate failed to increase the serum iron. The patient was then given parenteral iron-dextran without benefit, and a second oral test remained ineffective. After a second course of parenteral iron-dextran, Hb was 11.5 g/dl, MCV 74.1 micrograms/m3, MCH 23.7 ng while the serum iron remained low (23 micrograms/dl) and ferritin increased to 587 ng/ml. A third oral test with ferrous sulfate was still ineffective, as was a test using 4 mg/kg iron. The first patient suffered from iron malabsorption, presumably due to iron deficiency. The second patient could have abnormal metabolism and/or abnormal ferritin.


A Retrospective Study Using Mentzer Index for Prevalence of Iron Deficiency Anemia among Infants Visiting Maternal Centers at the Age of One Year. Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. Characterizing anemia as microcytic and normocytic depends on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is an important parameter in differentiating many types of anemia. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. In this study, we aimed to assess the Mentzer index used by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Palestine as a useful tool in differentiating between iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia. We assessed for the prevalence of IDA among infants at the age of one year visiting the mother centers from seven West Bank provinces in Palestine. Medical records and hematology laboratory data of 3262 infants were retrospectively analyzed from the years of 2018 to 2020. The Mentzer index applied to all population by dividing mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microliter). A corrected Mentzer index was further calculated among anemic infants to include only microcytic (MCV with less than 72âfl) and hypochromic (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with less than 32âg/L) indices. Mentzer index calculations for the whole population showed that 29.1% were anemic (hemoglobin (HGB) less than 11âg/dl): 21.1% had mild anemia, 7.6% had moderate anemia, while 0.2% had severe anemia.

[[Effect of erythropoietin and its combination with hypoxic altitude chamber training on the clinical and functional manifestations of chronic glomerulonephritis]. To evaluate the efficiency of treatment for renal anemia in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN), by using erythropoietin and its combination with hypoxic altitude chamber training (HACT). Sixty-three patients (41 men and 22 women) (mean age 37.1 Â± 3.3 years) with CGN during the predialysis phase of chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated by anemia. Hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), and red blood cell indices (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)), platelet count, serum iron, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine levels were determined in all the patients at baseline and during a prospective follow-up. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured using with the Rehberg-Tareev test. Along with standard renal protective therapy, all the patients received either epoetin beta (n=31; Group 1) or its combination with HACT (n=32; Group 2). In Group 1 patients (n=31), erythropoietin (EPO) was given in an initial dose of 20-50 IU/kg thrice daily, followed by the dose being adjusted until the target Hb level was reached. Group 2 patients (n=32) received HACT cycles by the standard procedure in combination with EPO given in lower doses (20-50 IU/kg once weekly). A prospective .follow-up of the patients was carried out during one year. Following one year, the number of patients who had achieved the target Hb level was 74.1% in Group 1 and 87.5% in Group 2. Over time, there were increases in the concentration of Hb (from 108.6 Â± 19.4 to 124.5 Â± 14.09 g/l; p&lt;0.05), PCV, and red blood cell indices (MCV, MCHC) in the patients receiving EPO (Group 1). Besides an'anti-anemic effect, there was a significant decrease in the concentrations of fibrinogen from 6655 (4884-7634) to 3776 (3330-4884) mg/dL; (p&lt;0.05), serum creatinine from 159 (89--261) to 138 (79-258) pmol/I (p&lt;0,05), proteinuria from 2.955 (1.024-6.745) to 2.069 (0.539-4.279) (p&lt;0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in GFR from 62.3 (37.0 - 107.4) to 76.9 (46.0-96.0) mi/min (p&lt;0.05). In Group 2, the rise in the concentration of Hb (from 114.1 Â± 11.7 to 132.0 Â± 16.5 g/I (p&lt;0.05), PCV, MCV, and MCHC proved to be more pronounced than that in Group 1 (p&lt;0.05) and accompanied by an elevation in the counts of platelets (from 222.7 Â± 19.8.10(9)/1 to 249.3 Â± 21.9.10(9)/1 (p&lt;0:05)) and red blood cells (from 4.0 Â± 0.4-10(12)/1 to 4.34 Â± 0.3 X 10(12)/I (p&lt;0.05)). There was a more marked reduction in the degree of proteinuria from 3.092 (0.764-7.694) g at baseline to 1.600 (0.677-4.078) g one year later (p&lt;0.05) than that in Group 1 (p&lt;0.05). The increase in GFR from 60.1 (46.0-96.0) to 79.4 (44.0-120.0) ml/min (p&lt;0.05) and the fall in the concentration of fibrinogen from 5555 (4884-7770) to 4107 (3776-5328) mg/dL (p&lt;0.05) and serum creatinine from 166 (92-273) to 147 (92-152) Î¼mol/L (p&lt;0.05), which were observed in Group 2, were comparable to those in Group 1. Epoetin beta used in patients with CGN has an anti-anemic effect and leads to improved renal nitrogen-excretory function. Erythropoietin in combination with HACT used in CGN provides a higher anti-anemic efficacy and a more pronounced antiproteinuric effect.

Cross sectional, comparative study of serum erythropoietin, transferrin receptor, ferritin levels and other hematological indices in normal pregnancies and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. To test the correlation of the serum erythropoietin levels, serum transferrrin receptor levels and serum ferritin levels along with other hematological parameters in normal pregnant and anemic pregnant patients. In a prospective study, 120 pregnant women were recruited between 18 and 36 weeks of gestation; 53 normal pregnant patients, 67 anemic pregnant patients, in which, 17 had mild, 30 had moderate anemia, 20 had severe anemia. A blood sample was taken. The various hematological parameters, hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, percentage saturation of iron, serum erythropoietin (SEPO) levels, serum transferrin receptors (STfRS) were performed. For statistics, Student's 't' test, Pearson's Chi test, Mann Whitney test and Bartlett test were used as per data. MCV was significantly reduced in anemic pregnancies as compared to non-anemic pregnancies (80.2Â±9.6 vs 94.12Â±9.8fl, p=0.001), MCHC was also reduced in them (30.2Â±3.38% vs 34.2Â±2.33%, p=0.176), TIBC was significantly increased in anemic pregnancies (343.31Â±28.54% vs 322.88Â±23.84%, p=0.001), serum ferritin was significantly reduced (24.9Â±10.48Î¼g/L vs 31.03Â±9.98Î¼g/L, p=0.001), percentage saturation of iron was also reduced (53.85Â±13.21% vs 62.04Â±15.79%, p=0.0024), serum erythropoietin levels were significantly higher in anemic women (26.24Â±26.61mU/ml vs 18.12Â±19.08mU/ml, p=0.064). The levels were significantly higher in severe anemia (46.5Â±46.8mU/ml than in moderate anemia 27.4Â±28.1mU/ml and mild anemia 22.8Â±22.8mU/ml.

Context:
Determinants and characteristics of mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin concentration in white HFE C282Y homozygotes in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study. Elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is common in persons with hemochromatosis associated with HFE C282Y homozygosity. We evaluated data from the subset of non-Hispanic white participants in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to determine if elevated MCV in C282Y homozygotes is related to this genotype or to serum iron measures. Regression analysis was used to model MCV and Hb from transferrin saturation (TfSat), serum ferritin (SF), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, age, HFE genotype, Field Center, and presence of liver-related abnormalities in C282Y homozygotes and control subjects without HFE mutations (wt/wt genotype). Mean MCV was higher in C282Y homozygotes than in HFE wt/wt controls (94.4 vs. 89.7 fL in women; 95.3 vs. 91.2 fL in men; P &lt; 0.0001 for both). These differences were largely associated with increased mean TfSat and SF in C282Y homozygotes. Adjusted mean MCV was 92.0 fL (95% confidence interval, 91.1, 92.9) in female C282Y homozygotes and 90.9 fL (90.3, 91.5) in controls. Among women with SF in the reference range 20-200 microg/L, adjusted mean MCV was 92.9 fL, (91.7, 94.2) in C282Y homozygotes, 1.8 fL higher than in controls (P = 0.013). The adjusted mean MCV of male C282Y homozygotes and controls was similar (P = 0.30). Adjusted mean Hb was 0.2 g/dL higher in women with C282Y/C282Y than in controls. Greater mean MCV in C282Y homozygosity reflects increased mean TfSat and mean SF in men and women; an additional effect of genotype on MCV and Hb was detected in women.

Hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies and high blood homocysteine levels in patients with anti-thyroid autoantibodies. Autoimmune thyroiditis can be diagnosed by measuring patients' serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TGA), and anti-thyroid microsomal antibody (TMA). This study evaluated whether there were hematinic deficiencies, high blood homocysteine levels, and serum gastric parietal cell antibody (GPCA) positivity in patients with TGA or TMA. The blood hemoglobin (Hb), iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, homocysteine and TSH concentrations and the serum GPCA level in 190 TGA- or TMA-positive patients were measured and compared with the corresponding levels in 190 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We found that 31 (16.3%), 27 (14.2%), 12 (6.3%), and 2 (1.1%) TGA- or TMA-positive patients had deficiencies of Hb (Men&lt;13g/dL, Women&lt;12g/dL), iron (&lt; 60Î¼g/dL), vitamin B12 (&lt; 200pg/mL), and folic acid (&lt; 4ng/mL), respectively. Moreover, 25 (13.2%) and 48 (25.3%) TGA- or TMA-positive patients had abnormally high blood homocysteine level and serum GPCA positivity, respectively. TGA- or TMA-positive patients had a significantly higher frequency of Hb (p&lt;0.001), iron (p&lt;0.001), or vitamin B12 deficiency (p=0.001), of abnormally elevated blood homocysteine level (p=0.001), or of serum GPCA positivity (p&lt;0.001) than healthy control subjects. Of 190 TGA- or TMA-positive patients, 8 (4.2%) had lower serum TSH level (&lt; 0.1Î¼IU/mL, suggestive of hyperthyroidism), 163 (85.8%) had serum TSH level within normal range (0.1-4.5Î¼IU/mL), and 19 (10%) had higher serum TSH level (&gt;4.5Î¼IU/mL, suggestive of hypothyroidis). There are significant deficiencies of hemoglobin, iron, and vitamin B12, abnormally high blood homocysteine levels, and serum GPCA positivity in TGA- or TMA-positive patients. In addition, the majority (85.8%) of TGA- or TMA-positive patients had euthyroid and only a small portion (14.2%) of TGA- or TMA-positive patients had either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

Context:
Clinical significance of reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and to compare it with other conventional iron parameters. A total of 32 female patients with IDA (serum hemoglobin &lt;120 g/L and serum ferritin &lt;20 ng/ mL) and 18 female patients with iron deficiency (serum hemoglobin &gt; 120 g/L and serum ferritin &lt;20 ng/mL) were enrolled. CHr was 24.95Â±3.92 pg in female patients with IDA and 29.93Â±2.96 pg in female patients with iron deficiency. CHr showed a significant positive correlation with hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, serum iron, and transferrin saturation and a significant negative correlation with transferrin and total iron-binding capacity. The cut-off value of CHr for detecting IDA was 29 pg. Our data demonstrate that CHr is a useful parameter that can be confidently used in the diagnosis of IDA, and a CHr cut-off value of 29 pg predicts IDA. None declared.

[[Effect of erythropoietin and its combination with hypoxic altitude chamber training on the clinical and functional manifestations of chronic glomerulonephritis]. To evaluate the efficiency of treatment for renal anemia in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN), by using erythropoietin and its combination with hypoxic altitude chamber training (HACT). Sixty-three patients (41 men and 22 women) (mean age 37.1 Â± 3.3 years) with CGN during the predialysis phase of chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicated by anemia. Hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), and red blood cell indices (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)), platelet count, serum iron, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine levels were determined in all the patients at baseline and during a prospective follow-up. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured using with the Rehberg-Tareev test. Along with standard renal protective therapy, all the patients received either epoetin beta (n=31; Group 1) or its combination with HACT (n=32; Group 2). In Group 1 patients (n=31), erythropoietin (EPO) was given in an initial dose of 20-50 IU/kg thrice daily, followed by the dose being adjusted until the target Hb level was reached. Group 2 patients (n=32) received HACT cycles by the standard procedure in combination with EPO given in lower doses (20-50 IU/kg once weekly). A prospective .follow-up of the patients was carried out during one year. Following one year, the number of patients who had achieved the target Hb level was 74.1% in Group 1 and 87.5% in Group 2. Over time, there were increases in the concentration of Hb (from 108.6 Â± 19.4 to 124.5 Â± 14.09 g/l; p&lt;0.05), PCV, and red blood cell indices (MCV, MCHC) in the patients receiving EPO (Group 1). Besides an'anti-anemic effect, there was a significant decrease in the concentrations of fibrinogen from 6655 (4884-7634) to 3776 (3330-4884) mg/dL; (p&lt;0.05), serum creatinine from 159 (89--261) to 138 (79-258) pmol/I (p&lt;0,05), proteinuria from 2.955 (1.024-6.745) to 2.069 (0.539-4.279) (p&lt;0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in GFR from 62.3 (37.0 - 107.4) to 76.9 (46.0-96.0) mi/min (p&lt;0.05). In Group 2, the rise in the concentration of Hb (from 114.1 Â± 11.7 to 132.0 Â± 16.5 g/I (p&lt;0.05), PCV, MCV, and MCHC proved to be more pronounced than that in Group 1 (p&lt;0.05) and accompanied by an elevation in the counts of platelets (from 222.7 Â± 19.8.10(9)/1 to 249.3 Â± 21.9.10(9)/1 (p&lt;0:05)) and red blood cells (from 4.0 Â± 0.4-10(12)/1 to 4.34 Â± 0.3 X 10(12)/I (p&lt;0.05)). There was a more marked reduction in the degree of proteinuria from 3.092 (0.764-7.694) g at baseline to 1.600 (0.677-4.078) g one year later (p&lt;0.05) than that in Group 1 (p&lt;0.05). The increase in GFR from 60.1 (46.0-96.0) to 79.4 (44.0-120.0) ml/min (p&lt;0.05) and the fall in the concentration of fibrinogen from 5555 (4884-7770) to 4107 (3776-5328) mg/dL (p&lt;0.05) and serum creatinine from 166 (92-273) to 147 (92-152) Î¼mol/L (p&lt;0.05), which were observed in Group 2, were comparable to those in Group 1. Epoetin beta used in patients with CGN has an anti-anemic effect and leads to improved renal nitrogen-excretory function. Erythropoietin in combination with HACT used in CGN provides a higher anti-anemic efficacy and a more pronounced antiproteinuric effect.

In Group 1 patients (n=31), erythropoietin (EPO) was given in an initial dose of 20-50 IU/kg thrice daily, followed by the dose being adjusted until the target Hb level was reached. Group 2 patients (n=32) received HACT cycles by the standard procedure in combination with EPO given in lower doses (20-50 IU/kg once weekly). A prospective .follow-up of the patients was carried out during one year. Following one year, the number of patients who had achieved the target Hb level was 74.1% in Group 1 and 87.5% in Group 2. Over time, there were increases in the concentration of Hb (from 108.6 Â± 19.4 to 124.5 Â± 14.09 g/l; p&lt;0.05), PCV, and red blood cell indices (MCV, MCHC) in the patients receiving EPO (Group 1). Besides an'anti-anemic effect, there was a significant decrease in the concentrations of fibrinogen from 6655 (4884-7634) to 3776 (3330-4884) mg/dL; (p&lt;0.05), serum creatinine from 159 (89--261) to 138 (79-258) pmol/I (p&lt;0,05), proteinuria from 2.955 (1.024-6.745) to 2.069 (0.539-4.279) (p&lt;0.05), which was accompanied by an increase in GFR from 62.3 (37.0 - 107.4) to 76.9 (46.0-96.0) mi/min (p&lt;0.05). In Group 2, the rise in the concentration of Hb (from 114.1 Â± 11.7 to 132.0 Â± 16.5 g/I (p&lt;0.05), PCV, MCV, and MCHC proved to be more pronounced than that in Group 1 (p&lt;0.05) and accompanied by an elevation in the counts of platelets (from 222.7 Â± 19.8.10(9)/1 to 249.3 Â± 21.9.10(9)/1 (p&lt;0:05)) and red blood cells (from 4.0 Â± 0.4-10(12)/1 to 4.34 Â± 0.3 X 10(12)/I (p&lt;0.05)). There was a more marked reduction in the degree of proteinuria from 3.092 (0.764-7.694) g at baseline to 1.600 (0.677-4.078) g one year later (p&lt;0.05) than that in Group 1 (p&lt;0.05). The increase in GFR from 60.1 (46.0-96.0) to 79.4 (44.0-120.0) ml/min (p&lt;0.05) and the fall in the concentration of fibrinogen from 5555 (4884-7770) to 4107 (3776-5328) mg/dL (p&lt;0.05) and serum creatinine from 166 (92-273) to 147 (92-152) Î¼mol/L (p&lt;0.05), which were observed in Group 2, were comparable to those in Group 1. Epoetin beta used in patients with CGN has an anti-anemic effect and leads to improved renal nitrogen-excretory function. Erythropoietin in combination with HACT used in CGN provides a higher anti-anemic efficacy and a more pronounced antiproteinuric effect.


Cross sectional, comparative study of serum erythropoietin, transferrin receptor, ferritin levels and other hematological indices in normal pregnancies and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy. To test the correlation of the serum erythropoietin levels, serum transferrrin receptor levels and serum ferritin levels along with other hematological parameters in normal pregnant and anemic pregnant patients. In a prospective study, 120 pregnant women were recruited between 18 and 36 weeks of gestation; 53 normal pregnant patients, 67 anemic pregnant patients, in which, 17 had mild, 30 had moderate anemia, 20 had severe anemia. A blood sample was taken. The various hematological parameters, hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total iron binding capacity (TIBC), serum ferritin, percentage saturation of iron, serum erythropoietin (SEPO) levels, serum transferrin receptors (STfRS) were performed. For statistics, Student's 't' test, Pearson's Chi test, Mann Whitney test and Bartlett test were used as per data. MCV was significantly reduced in anemic pregnancies as compared to non-anemic pregnancies (80.2Â±9.6 vs 94.12Â±9.8fl, p=0.001), MCHC was also reduced in them (30.2Â±3.38% vs 34.2Â±2.33%, p=0.176), TIBC was significantly increased in anemic pregnancies (343.31Â±28.54% vs 322.88Â±23.84%, p=0.001), serum ferritin was significantly reduced (24.9Â±10.48Î¼g/L vs 31.03Â±9.98Î¼g/L, p=0.001), percentage saturation of iron was also reduced (53.85Â±13.21% vs 62.04Â±15.79%, p=0.0024), serum erythropoietin levels were significantly higher in anemic women (26.24Â±26.61mU/ml vs 18.12Â±19.08mU/ml, p=0.064). The levels were significantly higher in severe anemia (46.5Â±46.8mU/ml than in moderate anemia 27.4Â±28.1mU/ml and mild anemia 22.8Â±22.8mU/ml. Serum transferrin receptors were significantly higher in anemic pregnancies than in non-anemic pregnancies (1.40Â±0.0802Î¼g/ml vs 1.08Â±0.641Î¼g/ml, p=0.019) with rise being higher in severe anemia (2.28Â±0.986Î¼g/ml) than in moderate (1.4Â±0.816Î¼g/ml) and mild anemia (1.16Â±0.702Î¼g/ml). Various hematological parameters especially sTfR, serum erythropoietin, serum ferritin and sTfR/log ferritin levels correlate with the severity of anemia.


Determinants and characteristics of mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin concentration in white HFE C282Y homozygotes in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study. Elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is common in persons with hemochromatosis associated with HFE C282Y homozygosity. We evaluated data from the subset of non-Hispanic white participants in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to determine if elevated MCV in C282Y homozygotes is related to this genotype or to serum iron measures. Regression analysis was used to model MCV and Hb from transferrin saturation (TfSat), serum ferritin (SF), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, age, HFE genotype, Field Center, and presence of liver-related abnormalities in C282Y homozygotes and control subjects without HFE mutations (wt/wt genotype). Mean MCV was higher in C282Y homozygotes than in HFE wt/wt controls (94.4 vs. 89.7 fL in women; 95.3 vs. 91.2 fL in men; P &lt; 0.0001 for both). These differences were largely associated with increased mean TfSat and SF in C282Y homozygotes. Adjusted mean MCV was 92.0 fL (95% confidence interval, 91.1, 92.9) in female C282Y homozygotes and 90.9 fL (90.3, 91.5) in controls. Among women with SF in the reference range 20-200 microg/L, adjusted mean MCV was 92.9 fL, (91.7, 94.2) in C282Y homozygotes, 1.8 fL higher than in controls (P = 0.013). The adjusted mean MCV of male C282Y homozygotes and controls was similar (P = 0.30). Adjusted mean Hb was 0.2 g/dL higher in women with C282Y/C282Y than in controls. Greater mean MCV in C282Y homozygosity reflects increased mean TfSat and mean SF in men and women; an additional effect of genotype on MCV and Hb was detected in women.

Successful resection of ampullary carcinoma in a father and adenoma in a daughter with familial adenomatous polyposis following detection by surveillance: report of two cases. This report describes the successful resection of ampullary carcinoma in a 58-year-old man and an adenoma in his 28-year-old daughter after they had undergone proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Both patients had been monitored by surveillance endoscopy once a year since their proctocolectomy. The father was found to have an ampullary adenoma 26 years after proctocolectomy, and ampullary carcinoma was detected 2 years later, for which pancreatoduodenectomy was performed. Histological examination of the specimen revealed an ampullary carcinoma, 2.5 x 1.7 cm, that had invaded the submucosal layer, but no lymph node metastasis was found. The patient's daughter underwent endoscopy, which showed an ampullary polyp 6 years after total colectomy. Endoscopic mucosal resection of the periampullary lesion was performed, and histological examination revealed a dysplastic tubular adenoma 0.6 x 0.4 cm in diameter. This report reinforces the importance of long-term periodic surveillance of patients with FAP by gastroduodenal endoscopy.

Predictors of High-Risk Adenoma Occurrence at Surveillance Colonoscopy in Patients Who Undergo Colorectal Adenoma Removal. Surveillance colonoscopy is recommended after polypectomy because adenoma recurrence is common. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictors of high-risk adenoma occurrence at surveillance colonoscopy in patients who undergo colorectal adenoma removal and to clarify the association between age and recurrent colorectal adenoma. This retrospective study included 563 patients who had colorectal adenomas at baseline colonoscopy and who underwent surveillance colonoscopy. The risk factors for recurrent adenoma were evaluated and the 5-year cumulative incidence rates of overall and high-risk adenoma were compared according to age group. During a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years, 305 (54.2%) patients had overall adenoma recurrence, and 80 (14.2%) patients had high-risk adenoma at surveillance colonoscopy. In a multivariate analysis, old age (â¥60 years) and presence of multiple adenomas (3 or more) were significantly associated with high-risk adenoma (p = 0.002 and p = 0.006 respectively). TheÂ 5-year cumulative incidence rates of high-risk adenomaÂ were 7.4, 16.7, and 24.1% in the &lt; 50, 50-59, and â¥60Â yearsÂ group respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Old age (â¥60Â years) and presence of multiple adenomas (3 or more) were strongly associated with the occurrence of high-risk adenoma at surveillance colonoscopy.

Metachronous colorectal carcinoma with massive submucosal invasion detected by annual surveillance in a Lynch syndrome patient: a case report. Lynch syndrome is the most common form of hereditary colorectal carcinoma. It is characterized by the presence of germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. Mutation carriers have a lifetime risk of developing colorectal carcinoma of approximately 80%. Current treatment guidelines recommend periodic surveillance for colorectal carcinoma in patients with Lynch syndrome. However, the optimal interval between colonoscopies has not yet been determined. We describe a 54-year-old man with Lynch syndrome who was undergoing annual colonoscopy surveillance for the development of colorectal carcinoma. At 54, 57, 59, and 60Â years old, a colonoscopy showed high-grade dysplasia and adenoma. Therefore, endoscopic mucosal resection was performed. At 61Â years old, a colonoscopy showed metachronous colorectal carcinoma with massive submucosal invasion. He subsequently underwent laparotomy for colorectal carcinoma. Annual surveillance using colonoscopy can detect colorectal carcinoma at an early stage, leading to reduced mortality. However, some patients might require a laparotomy, as was the case here. More frequent colonoscopic surveillance might be necessary to avoid surgery for colorectal carcinoma in Lynch syndrome patients with multiple risk factors for interval cancer.

The influence of the surveillance time interval on the risk of advanced neoplasia after non-advanced adenoma removal. To investigate the incidence of advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma) at surveillance colonoscopy following removal of non-advanced adenoma; to determine whether the time interval before surveillance colonoscopy influences the likelihood of advanced neoplasia. Retrospective cohort study. Patients enrolled in a South Australian surveillance colonoscopy program with findings of non-advanced adenoma during 1999-2016 who subsequently underwent surveillance colonoscopy. Incidence of advanced neoplasia at follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. Advanced neoplasia was detected in 169 of 965 eligible surveillance colonoscopies (18%) for 904 unique patients (median age, 62.0 years; interquartile range [IQR], 54.0-69.0 years), of whom 570 were men (59.1%). The median interval between the initial and surveillance procedures was 5.2 years (IQR, 4.4-6.0 years; range, 2.0-14 years). Factors associated with increased risk of advanced neoplasia at follow-up included age (per year: odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), prior history of adenoma (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01-2.15), two non-advanced adenomas identified at baseline procedure (v one: OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.18-2.57), and time to surveillance colonoscopy (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.37). The estimated incidence of advanced neoplasia was 19% five years after non-advanced adenoma removal, and 30% at ten years. Increasing the surveillance colonoscopy interval beyond five years after removal of non-advanced adenoma increases the risk of detection of advanced neoplasia at follow-up colonoscopy.

Prediction of colonoscopic yield of neoplasia. To identify criteria which may predict yield of neoplasia at colonoscopy. Clinicopathological characteristics of patients undergoing colonoscopy for either surveillance for neoplasia or investigation of colorectal symptoms were reviewed. Logistic regression was used to analyse risks for detection of adenoma and carcinoma. A total of 493 consecutive colonoscopies was reviewed. In the surveillance group, risk for detection of adenoma was two-fold greater in the elderly (&gt;65âyears), in male patients and in those with a previous history of adenoma as opposed to carcinoma. In symptomatic patients, risk for detection of any neoplasm was three-fold greater in the elderly but was independent of gender and presence or absence of rectal bleeding. These data support a case for prioritization of elderly patients for colonoscopy. The value of surveillance colonoscopy in preventing colorectal cancer appears greater in patients with a previous history of adenoma as opposed to carcinoma. Strict selection of patients with non-bleeding symptoms may result in a colonoscopic yield of neoplasia comparable to that in patients with rectal bleeding.

Current treatment guidelines recommend periodic surveillance for colorectal carcinoma in patients with Lynch syndrome. However, the optimal interval between colonoscopies has not yet been determined. We describe a 54-year-old man with Lynch syndrome who was undergoing annual colonoscopy surveillance for the development of colorectal carcinoma. At 54, 57, 59, and 60Â years old, a colonoscopy showed high-grade dysplasia and adenoma. Therefore, endoscopic mucosal resection was performed. At 61Â years old, a colonoscopy showed metachronous colorectal carcinoma with massive submucosal invasion. He subsequently underwent laparotomy for colorectal carcinoma. Annual surveillance using colonoscopy can detect colorectal carcinoma at an early stage, leading to reduced mortality. However, some patients might require a laparotomy, as was the case here. More frequent colonoscopic surveillance might be necessary to avoid surgery for colorectal carcinoma in Lynch syndrome patients with multiple risk factors for interval cancer.

Amphetamine toxicity masked by concomitant Î³-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) ingestion. We report a case of a young male with amphetamine toxicity initially obscured by concomitant use of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and the sympathomimetic symptoms emerged after GHB's effects receded. A 24-year-old unconscious man presented to emergency department showed the following vital signs upon admission: blood pressure 136/58 mmHg; heart rate 79 bpm; SpO2 87% under ambient air; body temperature 36.1 Â°C; Glasgow Coma Scale score 3. The pupils were not dilated. Arterial blood gas test revealed respiratory acidosis (pH = 7.229, pCO2 = 64.4 mmHg, pO2 = 42.3 mmHg, HCO3 = 26.3 mmol/L). Intubation was performed and the patient was transferred to intensive care unit. The patient regained consciousness and became agitated in association with sinus tachycardia (heartrate 143 bpm; blood pressure 173/61 mmHg). A few hours later, he experienced abrupt desaturation (SpO2 65%) and profuse, pinkish, frothy sputum. Chest radiography revealed a bat-wing perihilar shadowing, and computed tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacity and an alveolar pattern from acute pulmonary edema. A high dose of benzodiazepine with a midazolam pump at 50 mg/h was administered to relieve symptoms. The patient's friends confessed to concomitant use of amphetamine and GHB. The urine toxicology result was positive for amphetamine (â§500 ng/mL). The patient improved later and was extubated at 4 days after the mitigation of pneumonia and discharged uneventfully 8 days later. In our patient, amphetamine intoxication was initially masked by concomitant use of GHB but appeared as GHB's effect attenuated. We wish to remind clinicians of variable clinical presentations of polydrug abuse.

[An anticholinergic syndrome with hallucinatory psychosis after diphenhydramine poisoning]. A 27-year-old female student was hospitalized as an emergency because of gait and speech disorders which had developed over just a few hours. Conflicts with her partner and frequent alcohol abuse were reported. It was not possible to interview the patient herself. Consciousness was clouded by optical and acoustic hallucination. Body temperature was 38.1 degrees C: the skin was warm and dry, the tongue dry. Heart rate was 120/min, blood pressure 150/100 mm Hg. Neck and limb muscle tone was increased. Hallucinatory psychosis, encephalitis and alcohol withdrawal delirium were considered in the differential diagnosis. There was hypokalaemia, slightly increased serum creatinine and metabolic alkalosis. The alcohol level was 0.18%. The ECG was normal except for sinus tachycardia. In the meantime, two empty packets of 20 tablets each had been found in the patient's flat. They had contained Vivinox and Sediat (total of 1.5 g diphenhydramine), so that a central anticholinergic syndrome due to an overdose with this drug could be assumed. The diphenhydramine level was 2.8 micrograms/ml. After administration of altogether four times 2 mg physostigmine and 5 mg diazepam intravenously and normalization of electrolytes the symptoms regressed within 12 hours. The patient then admitted to having taken the drugs with suicidal intent. She was transferred to the psychiatric department because of the risk of further suicidal attempts.

Laboratory confirmation of scopolamine co-intoxication in patients using tainted heroin. First described in 1995, at least 325 patients with a history of heroin use have since required emergency medical evaluation in several eastern US cities, because of an anticholinergic toxidrome following use of heroin. This co-intoxication has been alleged to result from an atropine-like compound. We report the clinical findings and laboratory analysis of one of several individuals who presented to our Emergency Department during this epidemic. A 23-year-old male was one of 3 patients brought to the Emergency Department due to agitated behavior after insufflating heroin. Following physical and chemical restraint, vital signs were pulse 134 bpm, BP 160/90 mm Hg, RR 24/min, and T 37.3 degrees C. Physical examination was remarkable for dilated pupils 8-9 mm without nystagmus, along with dry mouth, decreased bowel sounds, and flushed dry skin. A bladder catheter was placed and 500 mL of urine was obtained. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia only. Additional sedation was required for 12 hours until normal mental status returned. A small sample of the "heroin" used was obtained and analyzed. Scopolamine was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Further evidence of scopolamine intoxication was supported by identifying scopolamine in the urine of this patient. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed scopolamine to be the cause of anticholinergic findings in a patient following use of tainted heroin. It is unclear whether scopolamine is an adulterant or contaminant in this heroin. Patients with anticholinergic findings following use of heroin may be co-intoxicated with scopolamine.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 49 Year-Old Man Who Presents with Left Sided Weakness: An Update on Ischemic Stroke. A 49 year-old man with a past medical history significant for essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement in the right coronary artery in 2010 presented for evaluation of left hemiplegia. He was feeling well until three hours prior to presentation, at which time he fell while walking from his bedroom into the kitchen. After falling, he noticed that his left upper and lower extremities felt weak. He denied any symptoms preceding the fall or any loss of consciousness. On initial exam, the temperature was 99Â°F, the pulse was 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 191/100 mmHg, the respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 100% while breathing room air. His neurological exam revealed diminished strength in the left upper extremity: 4/5 arm abduction and adduction of the left shoulder; 4/5 elbow and wrist extension and flexion; and 4/5 extension, abduction, and adduction of the digits. The patient also exhibited slight left upper extremity pronator drift. The strength was also diminished in the left lower extremity: 2/5 hip flexion, extension, and rotation; 3/5 knee flexion and extension; and 3/5 ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Initial NIH stroke scale score was 5, otherwise, there were no focal neurological deficits and the remainder of his exam was unremarkable. Initial computed tomography (CT) of the head was negative for any acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct. A subsequent CT cerebral perfusion scan (Figure 1) was notable for areas of ischemia in the right cingulate gyrus as well as the medial frontal and parietal lobes. CT angiogram of the neck revealed bilateral atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; however, there was no evidence of any flow-limiting stenosis.

Crying, feeding and sleeping patterns in 1 to 12-month-old infants. The crying, feeding and sleeping patterns of 270 infants 0-12 months old were studied using a 24-hour schedule included in a questionnaire given to mothers visiting four well-baby clinics in Finland in 1987-88. Of these infants 78 were under 3, 84 were 3-5, 65 were 6-8 and 43 were over 9 months old. The results showed that the infants less than 3 months old slept on average 15.2 hours per day, whereas those over 9 months slept 13.4 hours. The sleeping periods were longer at night. Continuous night-time sleep for at least 6 hours was noted in 35% of the infants under 3 months old and the proportion increased to 72% by the age of 9-12 months. The youngest infants were fed on average 6-7 times per day at 2- to 3-hour intervals in the daytime and at 4- to 6-hour intervals at night. The number of feedings decreased slightly with age. The average total crying time decreased from 1.6 hours per day for the youngest group to 1.1 hours for the 9-12 months old. At the time of the study, 23 mothers felt the need for help because of excessive crying or night waking. The help needed ranged from information about colic and child care, help with housework or the baby and encouragement. Of the mothers who needed help, a significantly higher proportion had a first-born baby compared with those not in need of help. There were also significant differences in the mothers' perception of the cry and feelings towards it.

Duration of exclusive breastfeeding and subsequent child feeding adequacy. Mothers of young children in Ghana believe that breastfeeding exclusively for six months impairs subsequent introduction of other foods. The current study was designed to determine whether feeding adequacy among 9-23 months old children is influenced by duration of exclusive breastfeeding. We surveyed 300 mother-infant pairs attending child-welfare-clinic at the University of Ghana Hospital, Accra. Data collected included sociodemographic characteristics, morbidity, breastfeeding history, and maternal practices and perception on child feeding and temperament. Current child feeding was assessed using 24-hour dietary recall. Adequately fed children were defined as 9-23 month old children meeting three basic feeding adequacy thresholds: 1) was fed complementary foods, at least three times in the last 24 hours, 2) was fed from at least three food groups, and 3) received breast milk in the last 24 hours. Multiple logistic regressions were used to identify independent predictors of child feeding adequacy. About 66% of children were exclusively breastfed for six months and only 56% were adequately fed in the in the 24 hours preceding the survey. Child feeding adequacy was unrelated to duration of exclusive breastfeeding (OR=0.73; p=0.30). After controlling for child sex, age, and maternal education, the independent determinants of feeding adequacy included recent child morbidity (OR=0.41; p=0.03), number of caregivers who feed child (OR=1.33; p=0.03), and maternal perception that child does not like food (OR=0.25; p&lt;0.01). Child temperament was unrelated to feeding adequacy. Child feeding adequacy is not affected by duration of exclusive breastfeeding. The study provides evidence to address misperceptions about exclusively breastfeeding for six months.

Context:
Extraordinary changes in behavior in an infant after a brief separation. A previously healthy 8-month-old infant experienced a dramatic change in affect, motor patterns, and appetite after a brief (4-day) separation from her parents. She went from being a happy, interactive, and engaging child to being withdrawn, with limited vocalization, spontaneous motor activity, or interest in her environment. For the first 3 days after her parents returned home, she refused solid food and most of the formula or water she was offered. Over the following week, her appetite increased minimally. Her parents were concerned about her apathy, excessive quietness, and lack of interest in food, toys, or their own attempts to engage her in play. At the pediatrician's office, she was significantly less interactive and playful compared with previous visits. Her temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were normal. Although there were no objective signs of dehydration, her weight was 8 ounces less than the previous recorded weight 1 month ago. Results of the physical examination were normal, with the exception of neurological and behavioral findings. She had mild, generalized decreased tone and strength, with normal deep tendon reflexes, a sad facial appearance with sustained furrowing of the lines in her forehead, difficulty in eliciting a social smile, and limited spontaneous sounds. There was an absence of focal neurological findings, a flat open anterior fontanel, and a head circumference measurement consistent with previous recorded results. There were no cutaneous bruises, and findings of her funduscopic examination did not reveal retinal hemorrhage. Before the 4-day holiday, child care was provided almost exclusively by her mother at home. On only two previous occasions, at 4 and 6 months of age, this first child of 20-year-old high school graduate parents was cared for by a neighbor when the parents went out to a movie theater. She cried for about 10 minutes when the parents left on these occasions. Her mother stated that she felt anxious about leaving the child for several days, but she and her husband decided that they needed a break and planned the 4-day vacation. Child care was provided by the neighbor, who did not notice any unusual behavior or refusal to feed while in her care during the parents' absence.

A 34-year-old male presented to the emergency department with severe periumbilical pain, emesis and a prior syncopal episode. He noted a 3-month history of intermittent, colicky periumbilical pain. His abdominal examination demonstrated a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant, involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness. CT demonstrated dilated small-bowel loops and findings suggestive of ischemia. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room where a diagnosis of pericecal hernia was made. The patient underwent a reduction of the hernia and a repair of the mesenteric defect.

A mesenteric hernia complicated with a triple necrotic volvulus. A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the paediatric emergency department with colicky abdominal pain. She had a significant medical history, with four previous admissions due to recurrent abdominal pain in the past year. On examination the abdomen was soft, there was no rebound tenderness and Rovsing's sign was negative. Her blood tests revealed a raised white cells count, although her C reactive protein was within the normal range. Abdominal x-ray revealed small bowel obstruction. During her assessment the patient rapidly deteriorated and seemed to go into shock. Her clinical state in addition to the radiological findings meant that she was taken to theatre for surgical exploration. This showed a triple volvulus with necrotic bowel loops that had herniated through a mesenteric defect. The necrotic bowel was subsequently resected.

Visualization of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes at US examination. Clinical significance. To identify conditions associated with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in children with acute abdominal pain and determine the ability of US to detect associated abnormalities. Two hundred and fifty children with acute abdominal pain were evaluated for the presence of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (AP diameter &gt; 4 mm). Additionally, a reference group of 50 asymptomatic children was also studied for the presence of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were noted in 35 (14%) symptomatic children and two (4%) asymptomatic children. A specific diagnosis was established in 16/35 (46%) symptomatic children with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Acute appendicitis was the most common diagnosis. The discharge diagnosis in the remaining 19 children was abdominal pain or gastroenteritis of unknown origin. US suggested the correct diagnosis in 12/16 (75%) children in whom a definite diagnosis was established. Histopathologic examination of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in three patients demonstrated non-specific inflammatory changes. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in children with acute abdominal pain represents a nonspecific finding. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy is associated with a variety of medical and surgical conditions in symptomatic children and is occasionally seen in asymptomatic children. Sonography is useful in establishing a primary diagnosis in these children.

Abdominal Pain and Intermittent Fevers in a 16-Year-Old Girl. A 16-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with intermittent fevers and worsening abdominal pain of 5 weeks duration. She had a history of travel to a less developed country and exposure to possible infectious diseases. Abdominal imaging and blood tests revealed diffuse mesenteric lymphadenopathy, elevated transaminases, and elevation of inflammatory markers. Gastroesophageal and colon endoscopies revealed gastric ulcers, and the patient was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis given the lymphadenopathy seen on imaging, serositis, sacroiliac joint stiffness noted on physical examination, and pain relief with celecoxib. She presented again 4 days later with worsening abdominal tenderness, elevated transaminases, and new-onset abdominal distention. Tissue biopsy yielded the diagnosis and directed appropriate treatment.

Pericecal hernia: a rare form of internal hernias. We report a rare and interesting case of a pericecal hernia. A 34-year-old male presented to the emergency department with severe periumbilical pain, emesis and a prior syncopal episode. He noted a 3-month history of intermittent, colicky periumbilical pain. His abdominal examination demonstrated a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant, involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness. CT demonstrated dilated small-bowel loops and findings suggestive of ischemia. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room where a diagnosis of pericecal hernia was made. The patient underwent a reduction of the hernia and a repair of the mesenteric defect.


Dysuria, Rebound Tenderness, and a Palpable Mass-A Ticking Time Bomb. A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department with the complaint of periumbilical abdominal pain, radiating to just above pubic symphysis. The patient reported that the pain was worse with urination and associated with chills and nausea. This case reports discusses the Emergency Department (ED) course and subsequent treatment of a patient found to have an infected urachal cyst, a previously asymptomatic embryological anomaly in an otherwise healthy middle-aged adult male. This is a crucial diagnosis to make in order to avoid the potential for significant morbidity and/or mortality, given the unlikely symptomatic source.

A mesenteric hernia complicated with a triple necrotic volvulus. A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the paediatric emergency department with colicky abdominal pain. She had a significant medical history, with four previous admissions due to recurrent abdominal pain in the past year. On examination the abdomen was soft, there was no rebound tenderness and Rovsing's sign was negative. Her blood tests revealed a raised white cells count, although her C reactive protein was within the normal range. Abdominal x-ray revealed small bowel obstruction. During her assessment the patient rapidly deteriorated and seemed to go into shock. Her clinical state in addition to the radiological findings meant that she was taken to theatre for surgical exploration. This showed a triple volvulus with necrotic bowel loops that had herniated through a mesenteric defect. The necrotic bowel was subsequently resected.

[Brugada syndrome, a rare cause of syncope]. The Brugada syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias due to cardiac conductance disturbance without structural heart disease. Mutations of the SCN5A gene cause either a reduction in cardiac Na(+) channel expression or alterations in channel-gating properties, leading to a reduction in Na(+) current amplitude. A 37-year-old patient presented after a syncopal spell preceded by dizziness. 6 years ago he had experienced similar symptoms. At that time, physical and clinical examination did not lead to a convincing diagnosis. The initial ECG showed typical signs of the Brugada syndrome with descending ST elevation in leads V(1) and V(2). The ECG changes could be observed over the next 3 days. Thereafter, ECG changes reversed to normal. Ultrasound examination did not show any signs of structural heart disease. During electrophysiological testing no sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were inducible. Molecular genetic analysis in this young patient revealed a mutation in the SCN5A gene. According to the patient's symptoms, an automatic cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted. A history of unexplained syncope in patients with a structurally normal heart should raise the suspicion of malignant arrythmias caused by primary arrythmogenic disorders. The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome can be concluded from typical ECG changes (i. e., incomplete right bundle branch block, ST elevation in leads V(1)-V(3)) accompanied by typical symptoms and a positive family history. To date, there is no effective therapy of the gene defect or its pathophysiological correlate available. Therefore, ICD therapy is recommended in symptomatic patients to prevent sudden cardiac death.

[A case of Gitelman's syndrome presenting with the hypokalemic periodic paralysis]. We report a rare case of Gitelman's syndrome (GS) presenting with the hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A 27-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of transient weakness of the limbs. Past history was unremarkable, including the delivery and early developmental milestones, except for a transient limb weakness 7 times since the age of 15 years. The blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. The physical examinations were unremarkable. Neurologically, the patient was fully oriented. The cranial-nerve functions were intact. Manual muscle tests revealed 1/5 weakness in his neck and extremities. Sensation was normal in all modalities. The deep tendon reflexes were present but decreased mildly. Laboratory tests showed hypokalemia (1.9 mEq/l), hypomagnesemia (1.8 mEq/l), and hypocalciuria (40.0 mg/dl). Plasma rennin activity and aldosterone concentration were elevated. The molar ratio of urinary calcium/creatinine was 0.11 (&lt; 0.2). Arterial blood gas showed mild metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. Because of these data, the diagnosis of GS was made. Gene mutations in the renal thiazide sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC) have already been shown to cause GS. Although we searched for gene mutation of TSC, none of 25 mutations in 18 out of 26 exons which had been previously reported were found. This is the first report of Gitelman's syndrome presenting with the hypokalemic periodic paralysis in Japan.

Exercise testing in the presence of complete heart block. A 28-yr-old female presented for preoperative evaluation. The resting ECG revealed sinus arrhythmia with complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm and a ventricular rate of 43 bpm. The patient was in no apparent distress, and resting blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg. Physical examination was largely unremarkable, with the exception of a soft, nontender, movable abdominal mass. The patient complained of mild dyspnea with stair climbing, but she was otherwise asymptomatic. Although high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block is considered a relative contraindication for exercise testing, this patient was referred for an exercise ECG stress test to assist in determining whether a electronic pacemaker or other therapy was necessary. A symptom-limited maximal ECG treadmill test was performed using the Bruce protocol. The resting HR before the test was 47 bpm, and resting blood pressure was 70/50 mm Hg. Beginning with the first stage of the test, sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block was observed. The patient achieved 10.2 METs, with an HRpeak of 122 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 122/70 mm Hg. No ectopy was noted during exercise, no ST segment changes occurred during exercise or recovery, and the patient remained asymptomatic. The test was terminated because of the patient's inability to keep pace with the treadmill. On the basis of these results, no medical therapy or electronic pacemaker was recommended at this time, and the patient was permitted to undergo surgery for uterine fibroid tumors. This case illustrates that although complete heart block is a relative contraindication to exercise testing in some patients, the benefits of testing outweigh the risks.

Asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia: diagnostic pitfalls of Andersen-Tawil syndrome-a case report. Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) is a rare arrhythmia disorder caused by a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. Typical presentation includes a triad of cardiac arrhythmia, dysmorphia, and periodic paralysis. However, KCNJ2 mutations can mimic other disorders such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) making treatment challenging. A 9-year-old asymptomatic female patient presented with an irregular heart rate noted at a well-child visit. Physical examination revealed short stature and facial dysmorphism. An initial rhythm strip showed intermittent runs of non-sustained bidirectional ventricular tachycardia with a prolonged QT interval of 485 ms at rest. Exercise testing showed no significant increase in ectopy from baseline at higher heart rates. Cardiac imaging was normal, and the burden of ventricular ectopy was significantly reduced on a beta-blocker and Class IC antiarrhythmic combination. Genetic testing marked a D71N mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. Clinical distinction between ATS and CPVT is a challenge. Genetic testing in the above patient attributed a likely pathogenic variant for both ATS and CPVT to a single D71N mutation in the KCNJ2 gene. Further evaluation revealed no clinical CPVT, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation of genetic results in inherited arrhythmia disorders.

[A case of Gitelman's syndrome presenting with the hypokalemic periodic paralysis]. We report a rare case of Gitelman's syndrome (GS) presenting with the hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A 27-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of transient weakness of the limbs. Past history was unremarkable, including the delivery and early developmental milestones, except for a transient limb weakness 7 times since the age of 15 years. The blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. The physical examinations were unremarkable. Neurologically, the patient was fully oriented. The cranial-nerve functions were intact. Manual muscle tests revealed 1/5 weakness in his neck and extremities. Sensation was normal in all modalities. The deep tendon reflexes were present but decreased mildly. Laboratory tests showed hypokalemia (1.9 mEq/l), hypomagnesemia (1.8 mEq/l), and hypocalciuria (40.0 mg/dl). Plasma rennin activity and aldosterone concentration were elevated. The molar ratio of urinary calcium/creatinine was 0.11 (&lt; 0.2). Arterial blood gas showed mild metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation. Because of these data, the diagnosis of GS was made. Gene mutations in the renal thiazide sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC) have already been shown to cause GS. Although we searched for gene mutation of TSC, none of 25 mutations in 18 out of 26 exons which had been previously reported were found. This is the first report of Gitelman's syndrome presenting with the hypokalemic periodic paralysis in Japan.


Exercise testing in the presence of complete heart block. A 28-yr-old female presented for preoperative evaluation. The resting ECG revealed sinus arrhythmia with complete heart block with a junctional escape rhythm and a ventricular rate of 43 bpm. The patient was in no apparent distress, and resting blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg. Physical examination was largely unremarkable, with the exception of a soft, nontender, movable abdominal mass. The patient complained of mild dyspnea with stair climbing, but she was otherwise asymptomatic. Although high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block is considered a relative contraindication for exercise testing, this patient was referred for an exercise ECG stress test to assist in determining whether a electronic pacemaker or other therapy was necessary. A symptom-limited maximal ECG treadmill test was performed using the Bruce protocol. The resting HR before the test was 47 bpm, and resting blood pressure was 70/50 mm Hg. Beginning with the first stage of the test, sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block was observed. The patient achieved 10.2 METs, with an HRpeak of 122 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 122/70 mm Hg. No ectopy was noted during exercise, no ST segment changes occurred during exercise or recovery, and the patient remained asymptomatic. The test was terminated because of the patient's inability to keep pace with the treadmill. On the basis of these results, no medical therapy or electronic pacemaker was recommended at this time, and the patient was permitted to undergo surgery for uterine fibroid tumors. This case illustrates that although complete heart block is a relative contraindication to exercise testing in some patients, the benefits of testing outweigh the risks.




Question:
A 27-year-old man presents to the clinic for his annual physical examination. He was diagnosed with a rare arrhythmia a couple of years ago following an episode of dizziness. A mutation in the gene encoding for the L-type calcium channel protein was identified by genetic testing. He feels fine today. His vitals include: blood pressure 122/89 mm Hg, pulse 90/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). The cardiac examination is unremarkable. The patient has been conducting some internet research on how the heart works and specifically asks you about his own “ventricular action potential”. Which of the following would you expect to see in this patient?

[A] : Abnormal phase 1

Severe Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding in a Patient with Crohn's Disease: a Case Report and the Review of Literature. Crohn's disease (CD) is rarely presented with lower GI bleeding (LGIB) which eludes the clinician. A 25-year-old lady with severe rectorrhagia was presented with no history of constipation, diarrhea or abdominal pain. Colonoscopy revealed ulcers in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and terminal ileum. Crohn's pathologic features were detected in the terminal ileum. The bleeding was controlled via supportive care and IV corticosteroid. Recurrent LGIB was managed by prednisolone and azathioprine. The patient had an uneventful recovery. The clinicians should consider CD as a possible diagnosis in severe LGIB. Prednisolone and azathioprine efficiently control acute bleeding episodes and prevent the recurrence.

[Recurrent sanguineous and mucous diarrhea and spasms in a 46-year-old woman--manifestation of endometriosis in the colon sigmoideum]. Intestinal endometriosis is the most frequent extragenital manifestation of this disease. Sometimes patients even present with acute bowel obstruction. We report on a 46-year-old woman complaining about recurrent sanguineous and mucous diarrhea and spasms for several years. Colonoscopy showed a stenosis in the sigmoid colon without macroscopically visible alterations of the mucosa. Computertomography, ultrasound and barium contrast enema did not provide us with further information about the origin of the stenosis. Biopsies out of the mucosa at the stenosis showed typical endometriosis tissue. After starting a conservative therapy with GnRH-agonist gosereline the patient became completely free of symptoms. The coincidence of endometriosis and M. Crohn has to be taken into consideration. Therapy planning should include a close co-operation with gynaecologists and surgeons to transfer the patient to surgical intervention when needed.

Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis Mimicking Crohn's Disease. We present the case of a 24-year-old woman with complaints of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss for 3 months. An outpatient colonoscopy revealed scattered ulcers, suggestive of Crohn's disease (CD). Histopathology also favored the diagnosis of CD. However, after admission to our hospital for further investigation, a chest radiograph revealed pulmonary cavitations. A computed tomography scan suggested the diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Therefore, a bronchofibroscopy, a total colonoscopy with ileoscopy, and an upper endoscopy were performed. Not only were acid-fast bacilli present in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and gastric juice, but also in colonic biopsies. A complete resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms was achieved 2 weeks after starting anti-TB drugs.

[High altitude pulmonary edema at a medium height. A case report]. A 45-year-old, healthy, well-trained man climbed within 12 hours from 300 m above sea level to a shelter at 2500 m in the Tyrolean Alps. During the following 3 days he undertook ski tours to the surrounding mountains up to 3356 m. On the 4th day he suddenly suffered from headache, coughing and very severe dyspnoea even at rest, accompanied by loss of appetite and the feeling of suffocation. The following day he was rescued by a helicopter and taken to hospital. At the time of admission the patient was severely hypoxaemic (capillary PO2 = 25.7 mmHg), and the chest X-ray revealed signs of bilateral alveolar pulmonary edema localised predominantly in the right lung. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) was diagnosed because of the typical clinical course. Pulmonary gas exchange normalised within hours, and complete restitution was achieved within 2 days. The chest X-ray was normal on the 4th day after admission. HAPE is a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema which develops in healthy individuals usually above 3000 m. Among the predisposing factors are rapid ascent, severe physical effort, diminished hypoxic ventilatory response and abnormal fluid balance. The treatment of choice is descent to a lower altitude, administration of oxygen and of nifedipine and expiratory positive airway pressure.

High-altitude cerebral edema with absence of headache. Headache is the cardinal symptom of acute mountain sickness (AMS). The headache normally worsens, with increased cerebral affection and the development of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). A Norwegian expedition aimed to climb Baruntse (7129 m) in Nepal in 2003. At 5400 m a 35-year-old man felt exhausted. The next day he aborted his attempt at further climbing as a result of extreme fatigue. Over the next 24 hours he developed cough, dyspnea, and severe hypoxia before progressing to ataxia and blurred vision. At no point did he experience headache or nausea. The patient was evacuated by helicopter. He improved immediately after descent and recovered completely within a week. The speed of progression from AMS to HACE varies. Abrupt onset of HACE is occasionally reported. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) may induce severe hypoxia that can lead to rapid development of HACE. High-altitude cerebral edema in the setting of HAPE was the most likely diagnosis despite the unusual lack of headache. Rapid onset of HAPE with subsequent severe desaturation should raise awareness of the development of HACE, even in the absence of headache.

Effects of high altitude and cold air exposure on airway inflammation in patients with asthma. Eighteen patients with asthma were evaluated during preparation to climb to extreme altitude in order to study the effects of low fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), prolonged exposure to cold air and high altitude on lung function, asthma control and airway inflammation. Spirometry and airway inflammation (fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and induced sputum) were studied under different test conditions: hypoxic (FiO(2)=11%) exercise test, 24-hour cold exposure (-5Â°C) and before, during and after an expedition that involved climbing the Aconcagua mountain (6965 m). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and FeNO values were slightly lower (p&lt;0.04) after 1 h of normobaric hypoxia. FEV(1) decreased (p=0.009) after 24-hour cold exposure, accompanied by increased sputum neutrophilia (p&lt;0.01). During the expedition FEV(1) and forced vital capacity decreased (maximum FEV(1) decrease of 12.3% at 4300 m) and asthma symptoms slightly increased. After the expedition the Asthma Control Test score and prebronchodilator FEV(1) were reduced (p&lt;0.02), sputum neutrophil count was increased (p=0.04) and sputum myeloperoxidase levels, sputum interleukin 17 mRNA, serum and sputum vascular endothelial growth factor A levels were significantly higher compared with baseline. Patients with asthma with the lowest oxygen saturation during the hypoxic exercise test were more prone to develop acute mountain sickness. Exposure to environmental conditions at high altitude (hypoxia, exercise, cold) was associated with a moderate loss of asthma control, increased airway obstruction and neutrophilic airway inflammation. The cold temperature is probably the most important contributing factor as 24-hour cold exposure by itself induced similar effects.

Context:
[Mountaineering and altitude sickness]. Almost every second trekker or climber develops two to three symptoms of the high altitude illness after a rapid ascent (&gt; 300 m/day) to an altitude above 4000 m. We distinguish two forms of high altitude illness, a cerebral form called acute mountain sickness and a pulmonary form called high altitude pulmonary edema. Essentially, acute mountain sickness is self-limiting and benign. Its symptoms are mild to moderate headache, loss of appetite, nausea, dizziness and insomnia. Nausea rarely progresses to vomiting, but if it does, this may anticipate a progression of the disease into the severe form of acute mountain sickness, called high altitude cerebral edema. Symptoms and signs of high altitude cerebral edema are severe headache, which is not relieved by acetaminophen, loss of movement coordination, ataxia and mental deterioration ending in coma. The mechanisms leading to acute mountain sickness are not very well understood; the loss of cerebral autoregulation and a vasogenic type of cerebral edema are being discussed. High altitude pulmonary edema presents in roughly twenty percent of the cases with mild symptoms of acute mountain sickness or even without any symptoms at all. Symptoms associated with high altitude pulmonary edema are incapacitating fatigue, chest tightness, dyspnoe at the minimal effort that advances to dyspnoe at rest and orthopnoe, and a dry non-productive cough that progresses to cough with pink frothy sputum due to hemoptysis. The hallmark of high altitude pulmonary edema is an exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Successful prophylaxis and treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema using nifedipine, a pulmonary vasodilator, indicates that pulmonary hypertension is crucial for the development of high altitude pulmonary edema. The primary treatment of high altitude illness consists in improving hypoxemia and acclimatization. For prophylaxis a slow ascent at a rate of 300 m/day is recommended, if symptoms persist, acetazolamide at a dose of 500 mg/day is effective. Mild acute mountain sickness may also be treated with the same dose acetazolamide. Glucocorticoids are the first line treatment of the malignant form of acute mountain sickness. Nifedipine is effective only for the prophylaxis and treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema.




Question:
A 25-year-old man is in the middle of an ascent up a mountain, at an elevation of about 4,500 meters. This is the 4th day of his expedition.

[High altitude pulmonary edema at a medium height. A case report]. A 45-year-old, healthy, well-trained man climbed within 12 hours from 300 m above sea level to a shelter at 2500 m in the Tyrolean Alps. During the following 3 days he undertook ski tours to the surrounding mountains up to 3356 m. On the 4th day he suddenly suffered from headache, coughing and very severe dyspnoea even at rest, accompanied by loss of appetite and the feeling of suffocation. The following day he was rescued by a helicopter and taken to hospital. At the time of admission the patient was severely hypoxaemic (capillary PO2 = 25.7 mmHg), and the chest X-ray revealed signs of bilateral alveolar pulmonary edema localised predominantly in the right lung. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) was diagnosed because of the typical clinical course. Pulmonary gas exchange normalised within hours, and complete restitution was achieved within 2 days. The chest X-ray was normal on the 4th day after admission. HAPE is a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema which develops in healthy individuals usually above 3000 m. Among the predisposing factors are rapid ascent, severe physical effort, diminished hypoxic ventilatory response and abnormal fluid balance. The treatment of choice is descent to a lower altitude, administration of oxygen and of nifedipine and expiratory positive airway pressure.


High-altitude cerebral edema with absence of headache. Headache is the cardinal symptom of acute mountain sickness (AMS). The headache normally worsens, with increased cerebral affection and the development of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). A Norwegian expedition aimed to climb Baruntse (7129 m) in Nepal in 2003. At 5400 m a 35-year-old man felt exhausted. The next day he aborted his attempt at further climbing as a result of extreme fatigue. Over the next 24 hours he developed cough, dyspnea, and severe hypoxia before progressing to ataxia and blurred vision. At no point did he experience headache or nausea. The patient was evacuated by helicopter. He improved immediately after descent and recovered completely within a week. The speed of progression from AMS to HACE varies. Abrupt onset of HACE is occasionally reported. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) may induce severe hypoxia that can lead to rapid development of HACE. High-altitude cerebral edema in the setting of HAPE was the most likely diagnosis despite the unusual lack of headache. Rapid onset of HAPE with subsequent severe desaturation should raise awareness of the development of HACE, even in the absence of headache.

Clinical practice: Acute high-altitude illnesses. A 45-year-old healthy man wishes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro (5895 m) in a 5-day period, starting at 1800 m. The results of a recent exercise stress test were normal; he runs 10 km 4 or 5 times per week and finished a marathon in less than 4 hours last year. He wants to know how he can prevent becoming ill at high altitude and whether training or sleeping under normobaric hypoxic conditions in the weeks before the ascent would be helpful. What would you advise?

Unlocking the secrets of cytotoxic granule proteins. Cytotoxic lymphocytes largely comprise CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells and form the major defense of higher organisms against virus-infected and transformed cells. A key function of cytotoxic lymphocytes is to detect and eliminate potentially harmful cells by inducing them to undergo apoptosis. This is achieved through two principal pathways, both of which require direct but transient contact between the killer cell and its target. The first, involving ligation of TNF receptor-like molecules such as Fas/CD95 by their cognate ligands, results in mobilization of conventional, programmed cell-death pathways centered on activation of pro-apoptotic caspases. This review concentrates on the second pathway, in which the toxic contents of secretory vesicles of the cytotoxic lymphocyte are secreted toward the target cell, and some toxins penetrate into the target cell cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition to invoking a powerful stimulus to caspase activation, this "granule-exocytosis mechanism" provides a variety of additional strategies for overcoming inhibitors of the caspase cascade that may be elaborated by viruses. The key molecular players in this process are the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of granule-bound serine proteases or granzymes. The molecular functions of perforin and granzymes are under intense investigation in many laboratories including our own, and recent advances will be discussed. In addition, this review discusses the evidence pointing to the importance of perforin and granzyme function in pathophysiological situations as diverse as infection with intracellular pathogens, graft versus host disease, susceptibility to transplantable and spontaneous malignancies, lymphoid homeostasis, and the tendency to auto-immune diseases.

Host defense, viruses and apoptosis. To thwart viral infection, the host has developed a formidable and integrated defense network that comprises our innate and adaptive immune response. In recent years, it has become clear that in an attempt to prevent viral replication, viral dissemination or persistent viral infection of the cell, many of these protective measures actually involve the induction of programmed cell death, or apoptosis. An initial response to viral infection primarily involves the innate arm of immunity and the killing of infected cells with cytotoxic lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells through mechanisms that include the employment of perforin and granzymes. Once the virus has invaded the cell, however, a second host defense-mediated response is also triggered which involves the induction of a family of cytokines known as the interferons (IFNs). The IFNs, which are essential for initiating and coordinating a successful antiviral response, function by stimulating the adaptive arm of immunity involving cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), and by inducing a number of intracellular genes that directly prevent virus replication/cytolysis or that facilitate apoptosis. The IFN-induced gene family is now known to comprise the death ligand TRAIL, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML), all of which have been reported to be mediators of cell death. That DNA array analyses indicate that numerous cellular genes, many as yet uncharacterized, may similarly be induced by IFN, further emphasizes the likely importance that these cytokines have in the modulation of apoptosis. This likelihood is additionally underlined by the elaborate strategies developed by viruses to inhibit IFN-antiviral function and the mechanisms of cell death.

Mechanisms of granule-dependent killing. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cell-initiated cell death is one of the primary mechanisms used by higher organisms to eliminate viruses and transformed cells. In this context, target cell death is rapid and efficient and initiated via two main pathways, involving either the ligation of death receptors or through the granule-exocytosis pathway. The granule-exocytosis pathway has attracted much attention over the past 10 years and consequently, a mechanism for granule-dependent killing has become reasonably well established. In the granule-dependent pathway, several proteolytic enzymes called granzymes are delivered to the target cell, promoting the activation of a family of death-inducing proteases called caspases. If caspases are inhibited by viral proteins or are inactivated through mutation, granzyme-mediated proteolysis of other cellular substrates ensures the timely death of infected or transformed cells. Here, we examine the findings that have shaped our current understanding of the mechanics of granule-dependent killing and discuss recent insights that have clarified some long-standing discrepancies in the granzyme literature.

B cells induce apoptosis via a novel mechanism in fibroblasts infected with mouse hepatitis virus. B cells from nonimmune mice mediate the cytolysis of fibroblasts infected with the coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain A59. In this investigation, we report that splenic B cells and a B cell hybridoma induced the fragmentation of MHV-infected target cell DNA into a nucleosomal ladder pattern, characteristic of apoptosis. To determine the mechanism by which B cells mediated this killing event, we used criteria previously established for the killing of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and compared this B-cell-mediated killing to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-specific CTL killing of LCMV-infected target cells. Unlike CTL-mediated cytotoxicity, B cells efficiently lysed and induced the fragmentation of the DNA in their target cells in the presence of EGTA, arguing against a Ca(2+)-dependent granule exocytosis model for killing. In addition, paraformaldehyde-fixed B cells were able to kill MHV-infected targets. We were unable to detect TNF-alpha-associated cytotoxicity via bioassay with nonimmune effector B cells against the TNF-sensitive cell line, LM, or the TNF-alpha-resistant subline, L929.w, infected with MHV. Serine esterase inhibitors (benzamidine hydrochloride and N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester) blocked CTL-induced 51Cr release and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, the inhibitors did not block the B-cell-induced 51Cr release, but did cause an inhibition in the fragmentation of the DNA of the target cell. These data indicate that B cells are capable of inducing the lysis and DNA fragmentation of MHV-infected target cells similar to CTL-induced apoptosis. However, we show that the mechanism(s) by which these processes are induced by B cells is distinct from CTL-mediated cytotoxicity.

CCL5-CCR5 interaction provides antiapoptotic signals for macrophage survival during viral infection. Host defense against viruses probably depends on targeted death of infected host cells and then clearance of cellular corpses by macrophages. For this process to be effective, the macrophage must presumably avoid its own virus-induced death. Here we identify one such mechanism. We show that mice lacking the chemokine Ccl5 are immune compromised to the point of delayed viral clearance, excessive airway inflammation and respiratory death after mouse parainfluenza or human influenza virus infection. Virus-inducible levels of Ccl5 are required to prevent apoptosis of virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and mouse and human macrophages ex vivo. The protective effect of Ccl5 requires activation of the Ccr5 chemokine receptor and consequent bilateral activation of G(alphai)-PI3K-AKT and G(alphai)-MEK-ERK signaling pathways. The antiapoptotic action of chemokine signaling may therefore allow scavengers to finally stop the host cell-to-cell infectious process.

They identify a cell that is able to destroy target cells infected with viruses by exocytosis of granule contents, which induces the activation of caspases. Which type of cell is responsible for this process?

[A] : Macrophages
[B] : Neutrophils
[C] : CD8+ lymphocytes
[D] : Eosinophils

Erythrokeratodermia variabilis. The case of a 10 year-old Japanese boy with erythrokeratodermia variabilis is reported in addition to a review of the Japanese literature. The patient was first examined in our clinic on October 21, 1965, because of generalized hyperkeratotic lesions and erythematous lesions which had persisted since he was 3 months old. Hyperkeratotic and verrucous lesions were noted on his auricles and trunk, on which there were also sharply demarcated erythematous lesions of various sizes and shapes which were not elevated from the adjacent skin. Laboratory findings were within normal limits. Histopathological examination revealed a remarkable hyperkeratosis with a basket weave appearance, moderate acanthosis and a slightly thickened granular layer. Polyethylenglycol 400 and corticosteroid ointment were slightly beneficial to the hyperkeratotic lesions.

Pain, swelling and irritability in the sun: what is the diagnosis? A 7-year-old boy presented with a 24-hour history of severe burning pain affecting both hands that had started within minutes of playing outdoors. His mother reported that he had been running his hands under cold water and shaking his hands and head to try and relieve the pain. On examination, there was swelling of his hands, eyelids and cheeks. His parents mentioned that his hands and face had 'swollen in the sun' every summer from the age of 2âyears.A 3-year-old girl presented with a 2-day history of left upper limb swelling following a day of prolonged sun exposure. Examination revealed non-pitting oedema extending from her left shoulder to hand with no associated tenderness, erythema or rash. Her mother reported six previous episodes of irritability following sun exposure during which she would cry and flap her hands 'for hours'.Oral steroids and antihistamines were prescribed in both cases with little effect. Findings of routine baseline investigations were normal in both cases. A radiograph of the upper limb in the second patient disclosed nothing abnormal.

Melanocytic nevi and sun exposure in a cohort of colorado children: anatomic distribution and site-specific sunburn. Sun exposure and high prevalence of melanocytic nevi are major risk factors for melanoma, but the relationship between them is not well understood. This study examines the relationship between sun exposure (detailed by anatomic location and history of site-specific sunburns) and the presence of melanocytic nevi on 743 White children in Denver, Colorado. Parental reports of site-specific sunburns were collected annually for 2 years starting at ages 5 to 6 years. In the third year, nevi were counted and mapped by anatomic location. Nevus density was higher for boys (36.0 nevi/m2) than for girls (31.0 nevi/m2; P = 0.04). Nevus density was highest on the face, neck, and lateral forearms and was significantly higher in chronically versus intermittently sun-exposed areas (P &lt; 0.0001). Compared with girls, boys had higher nevus density on the face, neck, and trunk, and lower nevus density on the upper arms and thighs (P &lt; 0.01). In 2 years of reports, most subjects (69%) received at least one sunburn. The face, shoulders, and back were the most frequently sunburned areas of the body. When adjusted for host factors, total number of sunburns was significantly associated with higher total nevus prevalence (P = 0.01 for one burn). Site-specific sunburns were significantly associated with nevus prevalence on the back (P = 0.03 for three or more sunburns), but not on the face, arms, or legs. In this high-risk population, there is evidence for two pathways to nevus accumulation: by chronic sun exposure and by intermittent exposure related to sunburns.

When his mother visits the youth community health doctor, he shows signs of an anxiety disorder with stress-related physical symptoms. Patient B is a 15-year-old boy whose teacher suspects a gaming and internet addiction. After consulting the youth community health doctor, he is referred to a psychologist for further diagnosis of a social anxiety disorder. Frequent school absenteeism is associated with psychological problems. After excluding physical causes referral for further psychiatric assessment is recommended. As the medical advisor of the school, the youth community health doctor can play a role in this process.

Carlos: a 12-year-old boy discovers his mother is HIV positive. Carlos is a 12-year old Latino male who lives with his parents and his 5-year old sister. Carlos' mother is HIV positive. He was one year of age when his brother died of AIDS at the age of 3 years. Carlos' mother, who was severely depressed after his brother's death and continues to have episodes of depression, never informed Carlos about her HIV status. Carlos is HIV negative as determined by negative tests at birth and 18 months of age. Carlos developed numerous behavior problems in the past year. He was referred to the Children's Art Therapy Group sponsored by the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Mother, Child and Adolescent Program. The group is attended by HIV infected and affected children. Carlos did not understand why he was attending the group and asked his mother who was HIV positive. The mother eventually disclosed to Carlos that she was HIV positive. Subsequently, he was quiet, withdrawn and expressed anger in the art therapy group. His teacher, who was concerned about ADHD behaviors and academic underachievement in the past, reported that inattentiveness, poor concentration and forgetfulness were increasing in the classroom and his grades were falling. Carlos was referred to his pediatrician for an evaluation for ADHD. During the initial primary care appointment, a pediatric resident made a significant and positive impression on Carlos. The resident detected an underlying anger, and Carlos started to talk about himself and his family. The pediatric resident diagnosed ADHD, initiated medication, recommended classroom accommodations, and made a referral for individual therapy. Carlos continued to see the resident during monthly visits for monitoring ADHD treatment while encouraging Carlos to talk about home life, school and friendships.

Idiopathic torsion dystonia and writing tremor within a family. A 12-year-old boy had suffered from idiopathic torsion dystonia since the age of 8 years, which had never been relieved with pharmacologic treatment. His mother had exhibited primary tremor upon writing from the age of 10 years, but had not yet developed dystonia. Surface electromyography revealed paradoxical muscular contraction of Westphal in both patients, although the main abnormal findings in the proband and his mother were continuous tonic discharges in the arms and 4-5-Hz grouped discharges in the neck, respectively. The simultaneous occurrence of dystonia and writing tremor within one family, and the presence of the paradoxical contraction in both cases suggest that a certain type of dystonia and writing tremor may be pathogenetically linked.

Ictal HMPAO-single photon emission computed tomography findings in reading epilepsy in a Japanese boy. Reading epilepsy is rare. We report a 14-year-old right-handed Japanese boy who had had jaw jerking only while reading since age 12 years. The episodes occurred every time he read an English textbook and sometimes during prolonged reading of a Japanese textbook. The jaw jerking evolved to generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) on only two occasions during prolonged reading aloud. Routine EEGs showed no abnormality. After a few minutes of reading, however, the EEG showed bilateral 2-Hz, 150-microV spike-wave complexes with left frontotemporal accentuation, accompanied by jaw jerking. Ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [99Tc]hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) showed focal hyperperfusion of the frontal lobes bilaterally and of the left temporal area. Interictal SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal. The combination of valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) almost eliminated his symptoms. Ictal SPECT is a useful technique for seizure localization in reading epilepsy.




Question:
A 12-year-old boy is brought to a psychiatrist by his mother upon referral from his pediatrician. The mother describes that for the past 2 years her son has experienced episodes of repetitive blinking and sudden jerking of the arms. Additionally, she notes that he often clears his throat and occasionally makes grunting noises. These symptoms have waxed and waned in frequency, but they have persisted for the past 2 years since they first developed. The patient is otherwise healthy without any coexisting medical issues. Which of the following agents would be effective at reducing the severity and frequency of this patient's current symptoms?

[A] : Baclofen

Context:
Effects of clonazepam on self-induced photoparoxysmal responses. A 5-year-old girl exhibited daily episodes of repetitive blinking lasting 5-10 s. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed marked photoparoxysmal responses (PPR) at 3-20 Hz of photic stimulation and diffuse spike-wave bursts during sleep. A 24-h video EEG identified 11 episodes of repetitive blinking, 3 of which resulted in widespread spike-wave discharges. These suggested that the behavior of the patient represented self-induction of PPR. Valproate sodium was ineffective in decreasing PPR, as revealed by EEG, and the frequency of blinking episodes, but clonazepam attenuated PPR and significantly decreased the blinking behavior.

[School absenteeism as a signal for psychological problems]. We present two patients with frequent school absences. Patient A is a 12-year-old boy, diagnosed with developmental coordination disorder. When his mother visits the youth community health doctor, he shows signs of an anxiety disorder with stress-related physical symptoms. Patient B is a 15-year-old boy whose teacher suspects a gaming and internet addiction. After consulting the youth community health doctor, he is referred to a psychologist for further diagnosis of a social anxiety disorder. Frequent school absenteeism is associated with psychological problems. After excluding physical causes referral for further psychiatric assessment is recommended. As the medical advisor of the school, the youth community health doctor can play a role in this process.


Carlos: a 12-year-old boy discovers his mother is HIV positive. Carlos is a 12-year old Latino male who lives with his parents and his 5-year old sister. Carlos' mother is HIV positive. He was one year of age when his brother died of AIDS at the age of 3 years. Carlos' mother, who was severely depressed after his brother's death and continues to have episodes of depression, never informed Carlos about her HIV status. Carlos is HIV negative as determined by negative tests at birth and 18 months of age. Carlos developed numerous behavior problems in the past year. He was referred to the Children's Art Therapy Group sponsored by the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Mother, Child and Adolescent Program. The group is attended by HIV infected and affected children. Carlos did not understand why he was attending the group and asked his mother who was HIV positive. The mother eventually disclosed to Carlos that she was HIV positive. Subsequently, he was quiet, withdrawn and expressed anger in the art therapy group. His teacher, who was concerned about ADHD behaviors and academic underachievement in the past, reported that inattentiveness, poor concentration and forgetfulness were increasing in the classroom and his grades were falling. Carlos was referred to his pediatrician for an evaluation for ADHD. During the initial primary care appointment, a pediatric resident made a significant and positive impression on Carlos. The resident detected an underlying anger, and Carlos started to talk about himself and his family. The pediatric resident diagnosed ADHD, initiated medication, recommended classroom accommodations, and made a referral for individual therapy. Carlos continued to see the resident during monthly visits for monitoring ADHD treatment while encouraging Carlos to talk about home life, school and friendships.

Idiopathic torsion dystonia and writing tremor within a family. A 12-year-old boy had suffered from idiopathic torsion dystonia since the age of 8 years, which had never been relieved with pharmacologic treatment. His mother had exhibited primary tremor upon writing from the age of 10 years, but had not yet developed dystonia. Surface electromyography revealed paradoxical muscular contraction of Westphal in both patients, although the main abnormal findings in the proband and his mother were continuous tonic discharges in the arms and 4-5-Hz grouped discharges in the neck, respectively. The simultaneous occurrence of dystonia and writing tremor within one family, and the presence of the paradoxical contraction in both cases suggest that a certain type of dystonia and writing tremor may be pathogenetically linked.

47,Xxx in an adolescent with premature ovarian failure and autoimmune disease. Background: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is often associated with autoimmune disorders. The 47,XXX karyotype has also been associated with POF and other genitourinary abnormalities. Following is a case of a 17 year old with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), POF, 47, XXX and a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA).Case Report: A 17 year old Caucasian female was referred to the Adolescent Health Clinic for evaluation of oligomenorrhea with secondary amenorrhea. Thelarche occurred at 12 years, and menarche at 13 years of age. Since then she had a total of five menstrual periods, spaced 1-15 months apart and lasting 3-5 days. Her last menstrual period was six months prior to presentation. Past medical history was significant for chronic ITP diagnosed seven months prior to presentation, when she developed easy bruising. She was treated with IV gamma globulin and had a moderate response, but relapsed several weeks later. She was started on oral prednisone and had a good response, but continued to relapse whenever steroids were tapered. She was therefore maintained on prednisone 10 mg QOD. There was no family history of irregular menses or autoimmune disease. Physical exam revealed a well-appearing, slightly Cushingoid 17 year old. Physical and cognitive development were age-appropriate. There were no stigmata of Turner Syndrome. The thyroid was normal. Breasts were Tanner 5; public hair was Tanner 3. The external genitalia were normal and appeared well-estrogenized. The remainder of the exam was unremarkable. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a normal uterus and ovaries. Laboratory evaluation was significant for elevated gonadotropins and nondetectable estradiol. ANA was positive at 1:320 with a speckled pattern. Blood counts, serologies, complement levels, and coagulation studies were otherwise normal. Cytogenetic studies revealed a 47,XXX karyotype. The patient was placed on an estrogen/norethindrone hormone replacement patch for premature ovarian failure. To date, she has developed no further symptoms, and does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosis.Conclusions: A 47,XXX karyotype was found in a 17 year old with POF and ITP with a positive ANA. The presence of known autoimmune disease in a woman with POF should not dissuade the physician from evaluating for a potential genetic cause.

Gonadoblastoma in a patient with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis. 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome) is a rare cause of 46, XY sexual development disorder. The patient presented to our clinic with absence of breast development and lack of periods at the age of 17 years. Her history and familial history involved no relevant conditions. She had Tanner stage 1 thelarche, and Tanner stage 2 pubic hair development with no axillary hair development. External genital structure appearance was consistent with female phenotype and the patient had no palpable gonad. The patient diagnosed as 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis after evaluation of laboratory analyses, radiological methods and karyotype. The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Committee concluded that gonadectomy should be performed. Histopathologic analysis demonstrated gonadoblastoma. Gonad structures should be sought laparoscopically and once diagnosed, streak gonads should be removed prophylactically in patients with 46, XY complete gonadal dysgenesis.

Disorder of Sex Development: A Case of Late-Diagnosed Ovotestis and Its Postsurgical Follow-up. True hermaphroditism is characterized by the presence of both testicular and ovarian tissue. This case report aimed to describe a case of ovotestis in adolescents. A 17-year-old patient presented with undifferentiated genitalia. Thelarche occurred at age 14, menarche occurred at age 15, and menstruation was regular. Physical examination showed female phenotype, Tanner IV breasts, gynecoid hair, enlarged clitoris, and labia majora symphysis with a single orifice. The patient presented high levels of total testosterone. The left gonad contained typical ovarian tissue and the right gonad contained both seminiferous tubules and ovarian tissue (ovotestis). Vaginoscopy revealed a single orifice (urethra and vagina). Right gonadectomy confirmed the presence of ovotestis. Knowledge of true hermaphroditism is important for early diagnosis and proper management.

Bilateral inguinal masses or hernias in a female teenager with delayed menarche: Think of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS), a case report. Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) is a rare sexual development disorder with X-linked recessive inheritance. It is prevalent in 1:20400 to 1:99000 of female phenotypes, yet characterized by an XY genotype. Cases of CAIS usually present with primary amenorrhea together with unilateral/bilateral inguinal hernias. A previously healthy 19 year old sexually inactive girl presents to our clinics for delay in menarche and bilateral palpable inguinal masses 3 years ago. She has normal female habitus, tanner stage 3 and external female genetalia with sparse pubic hair. She has a family history of 2 aunts (mother side) having infertility with Bilateral inguinal hernias surgery. Hormonal tests showed male range testosterone levels. MRI showed bilateral inguinal masses with Mullerian structures agenesis and a misdiagnosis of Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRHKS) was interpreted. While karyotype showed XY genotype. She is then planned for bilateral orchiectomy. Final pathology of the 2 specimens taken showed testicular tissue correlating with CAIS. CAIS patients presents with near normal female external genetalia, absence of Mullerian structures, taller status than regular females and testosterone levels equal or higher than male levels. Different imaging types together with karyotyping are crucial in diagnosing and differentiating CAIS from other entities such as MRHKS and Swyer syndrome. Treatment debates include prepubertal or postpubertal gonadectomy correlating with the age related malignancy rate and site of testis followed by Hormonal replacement therapy. CAIS management needs a multidisciplinary approach and decisions by the patient or his family sometimes. CAIS must be suspected in any case of young females with bilateral inguinal hernias as in our case, and precise diagnostics tests such as MRI and Karyotyping must be done followed by biopsy or excision for diagnosis and then adequate treatment. Hormonal therapy must be continued after gonadectomy that is best to be postpubertal.

Erythema multiforme-like lesions in the course of infectious mononucleosis. The rash in infectious mononucleosis is usually diffusely macular. A 15-year-old boy presented to us with high grade fever, sore throat, malaise, body aches, and polyarthralgia. He developed annular, erythematous, and non-scaly eruptions on chest and right arm. Blanching erythema was noted on his trunk. He had bilateral tender cervical lymph nodes, severe pharyngeal congestion, petechiae on soft palate, uvular edema, infraorbital edema, and marginal tender hepatomegaly. Investigations revealed lymphocytosis and activated atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral smear, and positive monospot test. The boy subsequently recovered in one week with total disappearance of his rash. Epstein-Barr virus-related infectious mononucleosis was considered the most likely diagnosis for our patient. To our knowledge, this atypical case is the third reported case of annular lesions in infectious mononucleosis. Dermatologists and other clinicians should be alerted to this special presentation of primary EBV infection.

Context:
Pimecrolimus-induced tinea incognito. A 6-year-old boy was brought to his primary care provider by his mother, who complained of a pruritic rash near his right eye. The eruption was described as a small, erythematous, slightly scaly plaque at the lateral margin of the right eyelid. The child was in good health and took no medications. The diagnosis of eczema was made; the patient was treated with pimecrolimus cream b.i.d. to the affected area. After 2-3 days of treatment, the itching and erythema completely resolved; however, a rough and scaly plaque persisted. After 1-2 weeks of treatment, the itching gradually returned, and the lesion began to increase in size. Multiple, similar lesions appeared several centimeters from the initially affected area. Pimecrolimus was discontinued; topical nystatin/triamcinolone ointment was prescribed. The eruption continued to spread, and the patient was referred to dermatology for further evaluation. The patient presented to the dermatology clinic with multiple annular, scaly papules and plaques with central clearing. Excoriations and mild inflammation were noted around all affected areas (Figure). A potassium hydroxide examination of the lesions revealed numerous hyphae. The nystatin/triamcinolone ointment was discontinued; oral griseofulvin was prescribed. The eruption improved dramatically after 3 weeks and eventually cleared completely after 5 weeks of treatment. Topical 2% ketoconazole cream was applied b.i.d. for the final 2 weeks of treatment.

Erythema multiforme-like lesions in the course of infectious mononucleosis. The rash in infectious mononucleosis is usually diffusely macular. A 15-year-old boy presented to us with high grade fever, sore throat, malaise, body aches, and polyarthralgia. He developed annular, erythematous, and non-scaly eruptions on chest and right arm. Blanching erythema was noted on his trunk. He had bilateral tender cervical lymph nodes, severe pharyngeal congestion, petechiae on soft palate, uvular edema, infraorbital edema, and marginal tender hepatomegaly. Investigations revealed lymphocytosis and activated atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral smear, and positive monospot test. The boy subsequently recovered in one week with total disappearance of his rash. Epstein-Barr virus-related infectious mononucleosis was considered the most likely diagnosis for our patient. To our knowledge, this atypical case is the third reported case of annular lesions in infectious mononucleosis. Dermatologists and other clinicians should be alerted to this special presentation of primary EBV infection.

Pediatric fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. A 17-year-old girl, who had a sexual intercourse history, presented with fever and right upper quadrant pain. On physical examination, tenderness and percussion tender were identified at that quadrant point, but cervical motion tenderness was not identified. Plane X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography, and nonenhanced abdominal computed tomography, because of contrast agent allergy, showed no specific findings. Nonenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the high-intensity area in the surface and subcapsule of the liver. From vaginal discharge, polymerase chain reaction for Chlamydia trachomatis was positive. Considered physical and MRI findings, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome was diagnosed. After Azithromycin administering (1000 mg/day), she got better and discharged.

[Pelvic inflammatory disease: contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic approach]. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is polymicrobial infection in women characterized by inflammation of the upper genital tract, including endometritis, salpingitis, pelvic peritonitis, occasionally leading to the formation of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). PID primarily affects young, sexually active women, and it is highly correlated with having several sexual partners, intrauterine contraceptive device and sexually transmitted diseases. The spectrum of disease is caused most commonly by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 30-50% of cases. PID is responsible for severe acute morbidity and significant long-term sequelae, including tubal factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The following clinical features are suggestive of a diagnosis of PID: bilateral lower abdominal tenderness, abnormal vaginal or cervical discharge, fever (higher than 38 degrees C), abnormal vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness, with or without a palpable mass. In laboratory findings, there is presence of excess leucocytes, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Transvaginal ultrasound scanning may be helpful, and its sensitivity is up to 85%. It can identify inflamed and dilated tubes and tubo-ovarian masses. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in a final diagnosis in 95% of cases. In 15-30% of suspected cases, there is no laparoscopic evidence of disease. Treatment regimens for PID include broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The usage of parenteral or oral therapy, inpatient or outpatient regimens, depends on the patient's clinical condition. Considering the potential complications of disease, there is a need for good health educational programmes in reproductive period.

A 33-year-old white female with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. A thirty-three year old female presented to our emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On physical examination she was hypotensive with a firm, tender abdomen, cervical motion tenderness and a diffuse erythematous rash. A surgical diagnosis of Acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease was made during laparoscopy. Coagulant studies, liver function tests, culture results, and the desquamation of the patient's palms led to the additional diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome. A literature search failed to reveal any similar cases of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) occurring concomitantly. Patients may present severely ill with either of these disease entities but potential for serious illness is greater when both of these syndromes occur in the same patient. We conclude that in patients with a similar presentation, the symptoms should not be attributed completely to PID without further investigation and consideration of a concomitant disease process including TSS.

Pelvic inflammatory disease associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis: clinical correlates. The purpose of this study was to determine whether selected clinical features can distinguish salpingitis associated with endocervical Neisseria gonorrhoeae from that caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in black, inner-city adolescents. We reviewed retrospectively the charts of teenagers presenting to a university hospital outpatient department between January 1982 and January 1984 who were diagnosed as having salpingitis. We included all teenagers who presented with a history of low abdominal pain plus (1) either cervical motion tenderness (n = 15), adnexal tenderness (n = 13), or both (n = 57); and (2) either cervical cultures positive for N. gonorrhoeae and negative for C. trachomatis (n = 31) or cervical cultures negative for N. gonorrhoeae and positive for C. trachomatis (n = 54). Discriminant analysis indicated that the presence of breakthrough vaginal bleeding (standard regression coefficient [SRC] = 0.301; P = 0.023), current usage of oral contraception (SRC = 0.408; P = 0.009), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SRC = 0.522; P = 0.0002) were significantly more often related to the presence of endocervical C. trachomatis. However, we found no significant differences between the two groups for other variables that have been described as distinguishing features (i.e., duration of pain, fever, and leukocyte count).

At work a student was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, but the Mantoux and Quantiferon tests were negative. Physical examination was normal, without fever, lymphadenopathy or auscultation abnormalities. Laboratory investigation revealed a C-reactive protein of 2 mg/L. Pulmonary function testing showed a slight restriction. Immunological bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was rich of cells, especially T-lymphocytes of the CD4 type. CD4+/CD8+ ratio of the BAL was raised to 4.2, compared to a ratio of 2.4 in blood. There were no eosinophils found in the BAL. Conventional chest radiographs were performed, and showed multiple areas of consolidation in the bilateral lung fields, predominantly on the right side.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. Diagnosis: P. carinii pneumonia and primary pulmonary sporotrichosis. PRESENTING FEATURES: A 53-year-old man who had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a 3-month history of increasing dysphagia, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and an episode of syncope. His past medical history was notable for oral and presumptive esophageal candidiasis that was treated with fluconazole 6 months prior to presentation. Three months prior to presentation, he discontinued his medications, and his symptoms of dysphagia recurred. During that time he developed intermittent fevers and chills, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, and a cough productive of white sputum. He also reported a 40-lb weight loss over the past 3 months. On the day prior to presentation, he had chest pain and shortness of breath followed by weakness, dizziness, and a brief syncopal episode. He denied orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower extremity edema, jaundice, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, or diarrhea. There was no history of alcohol use, and he stopped smoking tobacco approximately 1 month previously. He smoked cocaine but denied injection drug use. The patient had never been on antiretroviral therapy and had never had his CD4 count or viral load measured. On physical examination, the patient was a thin, cachectic man who appeared older than his stated age. His vital signs were notable for blood pressure of 102/69 mm Hg, resting tachycardia of 102 beats per minute, resting oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, normal resting respiratory rate, and a temperature of 38.1 degrees C. His oropharynx was clear, with no signs of thrush or mucosal ulcers. His pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. His skin was intact, with no visible petechiae, rashes, nodules, or ulcers. Laboratory studies showed a total white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10(3)/microL, with a total lymphocyte count of 330/microL, hematocrit of 30.2%, a serum sodium level of 129 mEq/L, and a serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 219 IU/L. The patient had an absolute CD4 count of 8 cells/mm3 and a HIV viral load of 86,457 copies/mL. His arterial blood gas on room air had a pH of 7.51, a PCO2 of 33 mm Hg, and a PO2 of 55 mm Hg. Electrocardiogram and serial serum cardiac enzymes were normal. A chest radiograph showed bilateral upper lobe patchy infiltrates with left upper lobe consolidation. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest with contrast showed bilateral ground glass infiltrates with focal consolidation (Figure 1) and no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Induced sputum was negative for Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, or acid-fast bacilli. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. What is the diagnosis?

Screening for familial colorectal cancer: the need for continuing education. A case report. A 37 year old female patient was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer in our clinic five years ago (January 1998). The family history revealed three deaths due to colorectal cancer (maternal grandmother, mother's sister and patient's sister), and the patient's mother had been diagnosed with adenomatous polyps (endoscopically removed). Histopathological diagnosis was moderate / poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Resection of sigmoid colon was performed and adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out, with uneventful evolution. The patient was annually followed-up (colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, laboratory tests). The last admission was in January 2003. No recurrence or metastases were found. The patient's mother, who was admitted at the same time, had been diagnosed with urinary bladder tumor. Subjects with a personal or family history of colorectal cancer should routinely have a colonoscopy beginning from age 40 or earlier. It is important for such patients to be followed-up closely not only for recurrence or metastases, but also for detection and treatment of a second primary cancer at an early stage

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer associated with duodenal carcinoma: a case report. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disease, characterized by an early age of onset, right colon predominance and an association with various extracolorectal malignancies. We present a case of a 47-year-old woman who met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer from her past and family histories. She had undergone operations for uterine cancer (histology not confirmed) at age 35 and for advanced cancer of the ascending colon at age 45. Gastroendoscopy revealed a flat elevated lesion, 20 mm in size, with a protrusion (type IIa + Is) in the second portion of the duodenum in March 1996. Additionally, colonoscopy showed a flat elevated lesion, 30 mm in size, with an irregular and nodular surface (type IIa, laterally spreading tumor) in the descending colon. After the operation, the resected specimen of the duodenum histologically showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with a tubulo-villous adenoma which had invaded the submucosal layer. The tumor of the colon was histologically confirmed to be a moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion. A high frequency of replication error positivity (4/5 loci) was detected in both of the tumors. Reports of early cancer of the duodenum, associated with extracolorectal malignancies in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, are very rare in the literature. Although it is difficult to determine which extracolorectal tumor sites should be taken into consideration by screening programs, we believe that careful observation by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which includes the duodenum, is necessary for patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.

Context:
Large size, villous content and distal location are associated with severe dysplasia in colorectal adenomas. Adenomatous polyps are precursor lesions for colorectal carcinoma. The risk of cancer development has been associated with age and size, amount of villous component and high-grade dysplasia of adenomas. The subject-related and adenoma-related risk factors for severely dysplastic lesions were further investigated. The study was performed in 474 men and 339 women undergoing endoscopic removal at index colonoscopy of 1217 polyps. The male gender, cases aged over 55 and cases examined for rectal bleeding, showed an increased risk of colorectal polyps (odds ratios, OR = 1.95, 5.1 and 2.99, respectively). Adenomas synchronous with hyperplastic polyps of larger diameter (&gt;10 mm) showed an increased risk of severe dysplasia (OR = 6.94). Severe dysplasia occurred more significantly in younger subjects harbouring villous growths (OR = 4.28, p &lt; 0.03) and in larger adenomas (OR = 3.91, p &lt; 0.001). The risk for severe dysplasia in relation to gender, age, multiplicity and location was higher in adenomas of larger diameter and with villous content. Multivariate analysis showed that distal site (p &lt; 0.02), large size (p &lt; 0.001) and villous content (p &lt; 0.001) were the independent risk factors for severe dysplasia. Large size, villous content and distal location are associated with severe dysplasia in colorectal adenomas. The risk for severe dysplasia does not appear to be correlated with age.

Context:
Early colorectal cancer in a flat adenoma. A 56-year-old man presented with intermittent rectal bleeding of six months' duration. Colonoscopy revealed three left colon polyps, one of which harbored adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic mucosal resection (band-assisted colonoscopic polypectomy) was successful. Endoscopic ultrasonography did not demonstrate any local or regional spread; however, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan raised suspicion of an isolated metastasis to the liver. The patient's mother had recently died from metastatic colorectal cancer. When presented with the options of no surgery, postendoscopic mucosal resection, and CT-directed needle biopsy of the suspected isolated metastasis to the liver versus segmental resection of the flat adenoma site and wedge resection of the liver lesion for the maximum chance of a surgical cure, the patient opted for the surgical approach. Histopathology revealed no evidence of malignancy in the rectosigmoid colon, pericolonic lymph, or liver specimen. Awareness of increased risk of early cancer in flat adenomas with central depression is important because prompt recognition can lead to curative therapy.




Question:
A 32-year-old woman visits her primary care provider with the results of a recent colonoscopy, which was ordered after 3 episodes of rectal bleeding in the last month.

Education and management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Are we making progress? A case report. A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic for abdominal pain, diarrhea, intermittent rectal bleeding and weight loss. The family history revealed two deaths due to colorectal cancer (maternal grandmother and patient's mother). The colonoscopy showed hundreds of polyps throughout the colon, and an ulcerative rectosigmoidian tumor. The diagnosis was Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed. Histopathological diagnosis revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out. The patient had three brothers, without clinical symptoms. They had a colonoscopic examination for screening. Two of them were diagnosed with adenomatous polyposis - the first with classic FAP and the other one with the attenuated type (AFAP). The diagnosis of FAP can be made on the basis of either clinical or genetic criteria. When the family history, clinical features, and pathological findings are classic, the diagnosis is straightforward. Screening and prophylactic surgery are effective to prevent colorectal cancer in patients with FAP. Lifelong regular surveillance is necessary to detect and manage extracolonic lesions.

Screening for familial colorectal cancer: the need for continuing education. A case report. A 37 year old female patient was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer in our clinic five years ago (January 1998). The family history revealed three deaths due to colorectal cancer (maternal grandmother, mother's sister and patient's sister), and the patient's mother had been diagnosed with adenomatous polyps (endoscopically removed). Histopathological diagnosis was moderate / poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Resection of sigmoid colon was performed and adjuvant chemotherapy was carried out, with uneventful evolution. The patient was annually followed-up (colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, laboratory tests). The last admission was in January 2003. No recurrence or metastases were found. The patient's mother, who was admitted at the same time, had been diagnosed with urinary bladder tumor. Subjects with a personal or family history of colorectal cancer should routinely have a colonoscopy beginning from age 40 or earlier. It is important for such patients to be followed-up closely not only for recurrence or metastases, but also for detection and treatment of a second primary cancer at an early stage


Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer associated with duodenal carcinoma: a case report. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disease, characterized by an early age of onset, right colon predominance and an association with various extracolorectal malignancies. We present a case of a 47-year-old woman who met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer from her past and family histories. She had undergone operations for uterine cancer (histology not confirmed) at age 35 and for advanced cancer of the ascending colon at age 45. Gastroendoscopy revealed a flat elevated lesion, 20 mm in size, with a protrusion (type IIa + Is) in the second portion of the duodenum in March 1996. Additionally, colonoscopy showed a flat elevated lesion, 30 mm in size, with an irregular and nodular surface (type IIa, laterally spreading tumor) in the descending colon. After the operation, the resected specimen of the duodenum histologically showed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma associated with a tubulo-villous adenoma which had invaded the submucosal layer. The tumor of the colon was histologically confirmed to be a moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion. A high frequency of replication error positivity (4/5 loci) was detected in both of the tumors. Reports of early cancer of the duodenum, associated with extracolorectal malignancies in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, are very rare in the literature. Although it is difficult to determine which extracolorectal tumor sites should be taken into consideration by screening programs, we believe that careful observation by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which includes the duodenum, is necessary for patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.

Large size, villous content and distal location are associated with severe dysplasia in colorectal adenomas. Adenomatous polyps are precursor lesions for colorectal carcinoma. The risk of cancer development has been associated with age and size, amount of villous component and high-grade dysplasia of adenomas. The subject-related and adenoma-related risk factors for severely dysplastic lesions were further investigated. The study was performed in 474 men and 339 women undergoing endoscopic removal at index colonoscopy of 1217 polyps. The male gender, cases aged over 55 and cases examined for rectal bleeding, showed an increased risk of colorectal polyps (odds ratios, OR = 1.95, 5.1 and 2.99, respectively). Adenomas synchronous with hyperplastic polyps of larger diameter (&gt;10 mm) showed an increased risk of severe dysplasia (OR = 6.94). Severe dysplasia occurred more significantly in younger subjects harbouring villous growths (OR = 4.28, p &lt; 0.03) and in larger adenomas (OR = 3.91, p &lt; 0.001). The risk for severe dysplasia in relation to gender, age, multiplicity and location was higher in adenomas of larger diameter and with villous content. Multivariate analysis showed that distal site (p &lt; 0.02), large size (p &lt; 0.001) and villous content (p &lt; 0.001) were the independent risk factors for severe dysplasia. Large size, villous content and distal location are associated with severe dysplasia in colorectal adenomas. The risk for severe dysplasia does not appear to be correlated with age.

Marked hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria due to diuretic treatment. A 74-year-old male was admitted to hospital with acute rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria due to hypokalemia. The hypokalemia resulted from diuretic treatment. He had no family history of myopathy, and no diarrhea and vomiting. The neurological examination revealed painful quadriplegia. The blood pressure was 160/74 mm Hg. Laboratory examination showed hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (serum K 1.5 mEq/l, serum Cl 89 mEq/l, base excess + 20.9, HCO3- 44.9 mmol/l, pH 7.563) and marked elevations of serum CPK, LDH, GOT, GPT and myoglobin. Endocrinological and renal functions were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed marked necrosis with remarkable phagocytosis and vacuolar degeneration. The cessation of diuretics and intravenous infusion of potassium chloride resulted in a marked improvement in clinical and laboratory findings. The diuretics-induced hypokalemic myopathy is rare in the literature.

Hypotension and bradycardia associated with concomitant tizanidine and lisinopril therapy. A case of severe bradycardia and hypotension associated with concomitant tizanidine and lisinopril therapy is reported. An 85-year-old man with a chief complaint of profound weakness was admitted to the hospital with a blood pressure reading of 60/32 mm Hg and a heart rate of 37 beats/min. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, generalized anxiety disorder with depression, and severe chronic back pain for which he was receiving treatment at a pain clinic. Two days before hospital admission, he had been seen at the pain clinic and started on ti-zanidine. Additional medications included acetaminophen, chlorpromazine, citalopram, finasteride, lidocaine patch, lisinopril, metformin, pramipexole, omeprazole, simvastatin, theophylline, diclofenac topical gel, hydrocodone-acetaminophen, and ondansetron. After taking three doses of the newly prescribed tizanidine, he developed severe hypotension and bradycardia. Notable laboratory test values included a serum creatinine concentration of 1.90 mg/dL, a blood urea nitrogen concentration of 21 mg/dL, a serum potassium concentration of 5.5 meq/L, and a serum sodium concentration of 128 meq/L. Upon admission, tizanidine, lisinopril, theophylline, omeprazole, and simvastatin were withheld, and i.v. fluids were administered. The patient's vital signs began to gradually improve. Within 24 hours, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate had improved, as had the previously abnormal laboratory test values. Tizanidine was discontinued, and all of his other preadmission medications were restarted at discharge. The addition of tizanidine in a patient receiving long-term treatment with lisinopril was associated with severe hypotension and bradycardia.

[An elderly case of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome with hyperketonemia]. A 72-year-old man had been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus and gastric cancer. He had been receiving insulin and chemotherapy because of diabetes mellitus and terminal gastric cancer. The dose of insulin was decreased due to the appetite loss, but his general condition deteriorated with disturbed consciousness (JCS I-3), so he was admitted to our hospital in November 2006. On admission, he showed abnormal laboratory data such as WBC 11,070/microl, Hb 10.2 g/dl, serum BUN 64.1 mg/dl, serum Cr 2.23 mg/dl, serum CRP 16.78 mg/dl, plasma glucose 830 mg/dl, serum osmolarity 360 mOsm/l, and serum total keton body 5,490 micromol/l. However, serum Na (142 mEq/l), serum K (4.5 mEq/l), arterial blood pH (7.368), and the anion gap (15 mEq/l) were within the normal range. He was given a diagnosis of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome with hyperketonemia. Immediately treatment was started with physiologic saline and regular insulin infusion. After treatment, glucose level and serum osmolarity ameliorated. Though elderly cases with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and hyperketonemia are rarely reported, it is important to be aware that elderly patients often have very atypical signs and symptoms. We report this case to show diverse nature of elderly patients.

The hypokalemia resulted from diuretic treatment. He had no family history of myopathy, and no diarrhea and vomiting. The neurological examination revealed painful quadriplegia. The blood pressure was 160/74 mm Hg. Laboratory examination showed hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (serum K 1.5 mEq/l, serum Cl 89 mEq/l, base excess + 20.9, HCO3- 44.9 mmol/l, pH 7.563) and marked elevations of serum CPK, LDH, GOT, GPT and myoglobin. Endocrinological and renal functions were normal. Muscle biopsy revealed marked necrosis with remarkable phagocytosis and vacuolar degeneration. The cessation of diuretics and intravenous infusion of potassium chloride resulted in a marked improvement in clinical and laboratory findings. The diuretics-induced hypokalemic myopathy is rare in the literature.


[Central pontine myelinolysis--pathogenesis and review of the literature]. A 77-year-old, nonalcoholic man was admitted to the Omiya Red Cross Hospital with the complaint of fever and delirium state of two days' duration. Two months prior to admission he had had cough and sputum. Chest X-ray revealed honey comb lungs. Cultures of sputum revealed mycobacterium tuberculosis after eight weeks incubation. He had no liver disease in his past history. The patient appeared cachetic. His vital signs were as follows; temperature 38 degrees C, blood pressure 132/68 mmHg, with a pulse rate of 84/min. He was delirium and excited. Findings of the cranial, motor and sensory nerve examination were normal. Initial laboratory studies showed a serum sodium value of 133 mEq/l, potassium 4.5 mEq/l, chloride 98 mEq/l; a serum GOT value of 51 units, GPT 36 units; a total protein content of 7.8 g/dl and ESR rate of 87 mm/hr. Six days after admission, the patients' consciousness level began to stupor and nuchal rigidity was appeared. Spinal fluid examination revealed opening pressure 270 mm H2O, cell counts 720 (N 712, L 8)/cumm, sugar 57 mg/dl and protein 170 mg/dl. Spinal fluid cultures were positive in mycobacterium tuberculosis after eight weeks incubation. Laboratory studies showed a serum sodium value of 114 mEq/l, potassium 4.4 mEq/l, chloride 86 mEq/l, a serum osmorality (SeOs) 225 mOsm/l and urine osmorality (UOs) 958 mOsm/l.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Hypotension and bradycardia associated with concomitant tizanidine and lisinopril therapy. A case of severe bradycardia and hypotension associated with concomitant tizanidine and lisinopril therapy is reported. An 85-year-old man with a chief complaint of profound weakness was admitted to the hospital with a blood pressure reading of 60/32 mm Hg and a heart rate of 37 beats/min. His medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, osteoarthritis, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, generalized anxiety disorder with depression, and severe chronic back pain for which he was receiving treatment at a pain clinic. Two days before hospital admission, he had been seen at the pain clinic and started on ti-zanidine. Additional medications included acetaminophen, chlorpromazine, citalopram, finasteride, lidocaine patch, lisinopril, metformin, pramipexole, omeprazole, simvastatin, theophylline, diclofenac topical gel, hydrocodone-acetaminophen, and ondansetron. After taking three doses of the newly prescribed tizanidine, he developed severe hypotension and bradycardia. Notable laboratory test values included a serum creatinine concentration of 1.90 mg/dL, a blood urea nitrogen concentration of 21 mg/dL, a serum potassium concentration of 5.5 meq/L, and a serum sodium concentration of 128 meq/L. Upon admission, tizanidine, lisinopril, theophylline, omeprazole, and simvastatin were withheld, and i.v. fluids were administered. The patient's vital signs began to gradually improve. Within 24 hours, the patient's blood pressure and heart rate had improved, as had the previously abnormal laboratory test values. Tizanidine was discontinued, and all of his other preadmission medications were restarted at discharge. The addition of tizanidine in a patient receiving long-term treatment with lisinopril was associated with severe hypotension and bradycardia.

An interesting case of pachydermoperiostosis with idiopathic myelofibrosis associated with monosomy 22. A 24-year-old man was referred to our clinic in August 2003 with complaints of weakness, dizziness, and bilateral knee pain of 3 years' duration. Bilateral digital clubbing had been found on routine physical examination during his military service 4 years earlier. There were no cardiorespiratory or abdominal symptoms. There was no compromise in the activities of everyday life. The patient was not a chronic smoker. In the family history of the patient, his brother had been diagnosed with pachydermoperiostosis in another center 2 years earlier, but did not return to the hospital for a follow-up investigation of myelofibrosis. On physical examination, the patient showed marked drumstick clubbing of the hands (Fig. 1), and a pale general appearance. The causes of digital clubbing are shown in Table 1 (Fawcett RS, Linford S, Stulberg DL. Nail abnormalities: clues to systemic disease. Am Fam Physician 2004; 69: 1417-1424). Deep nasolabial folds were seen on the face. Skin hypertrophy, cutis verticis gyrata, and seborrhea on the face were also observed. The patient also complained of hyperhidrosis. Examination of the cardiovascular system was normal. There was bilateral swelling of the ankle and knee (Fig. 2). Hepatosplenomegaly was found on abdominal examination. Investigations showed hypochromic microcytic anemia [hemoglobin, 8.58 g/dL (normal, 12.2-18.1 g/dL); hematocrit, 28.1% (normal, 37.7-53.7%); white blood cell count, 3430/mm(3) (normal, 4600-10,200/mm(3)); neutrophils, 2470/mm(3) (normal, 2000-6900/mm(3)); lymphocytes, 820/mm(3) (normal, 600-3400/mm(3)); platelets, 162,000/mm(3) (normal, 142,000-424,000 mm(3)); mean corpuscular volume, 73.7 fL (normal, 80-97 fL)]. Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, microcytosis, and hypochromia were observed on peripheral blood examination, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 37 mm/h. The serum C-reactive protein level was 50.1 mg/L (normal, 0-5 mg/L). Biochemical parameters, including serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphates and liver function tests, were found to be within the normal range. The causes of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with pulmonary, rheumatologic, endocrine, cardiac, and gastroenterologic disorders were excluded. Growth hormone level and thyroid function tests were normal. Antinuclear antibody, TORCH [Toxoplasma immunoglobulin M (IgM), rubella IgM, cytomegalovirus IgM, herpes simplex IgM] panel, and markers of hepatitis were negative. Serum Igs and rheumatoid factor were found to be within the normal range. There was subperiosteal new bone formation on bilateral knee X-ray (Fig. 3). Radiography of the chest, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas, and echocardiography were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Amyloid deposition was not determined in rectal biopsy. Reticulin-type myelofibrosis was found on bone marrow biopsy (Figs 4 and 5). In the cytogenetic study, monosomy 22 was detected in four of 20 metaphase plates.

Anemia associated with new-onset diabetes: improvement with blood glucose control. To evaluate the mild normochromic normocytic anemia associated with new-onset diabetes in young, otherwise healthy patients. We undertook a retrospective review of medical records of patients with new-onset diabetes and unexplained anemia. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 12.5 g/dL in women and less than 14 g/dL in men. Patients with obvious causes of anemia, such as renal insufficiency, infection, pancreatitis, deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis, or acute or chronic blood loss, were excluded from the study. In 16 otherwise seemingly healthy patients with new-onset diabetes, a normochromic normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 86.4 +/- 4 fL) was diagnosed at initial assessment. These 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) had a mean age of 33 +/- 10 years. At diagnosis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 15.5 +/- 3.4%, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 +/- 0.6 g/dL, and the mean hematocrit was 36.2 +/- 2%. All patients were treated with insulin. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 +/- 17 months, insulin treatment resulted in a decline in HbA1c to 7.7 +/- 1.7% (P&lt;0.001; confidence interval [CI], 5.7 to 9.8). The hemoglobin concentration increased to 14.3 +/- 0.9 g/dL (P&lt;0.001; CI, 1.22 to 2.38), and the hematocrit increased to 42.1 +/- 1.9% (P&lt;0.001; CI, 3.59 to 7.04). All patients had hemoglobin AA and normal levels of hemoglobin A2. Men and women had equal improvement in hematologic variables after improvement in glycemic control. Some patients with new-onset diabetes have a mild normochromic normocytic anemia that is not attributable to usual causes, such as infection, pancreatitis, or blood loss. Improvement in glycemic control tends to be associated with normalization of hemoglobin levels. The cause of such cases of anemia may be either direct "glucose toxicity" to erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow or perhaps oxidative stress to mature erythrocytes.

Two cases of acute erythroid leukemia presenting with marked macrocytic anemia, reticulocytosis and hemolysis. Case 1. The laboratory findings of a hematological analysis of a 53-year-old woman with palpitations and dyspnea revealed the following: red blood cell (RBC) count: 9.4Ã10(5)/Î¼L with 60.0â° reticulocytes; Hb: 3.7 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 124.5 fL; white blood cell (WBC) count: 2,800/Î¼L with 10.0% myeloblasts. Case 2. Similarly, a 42-year-old man with dizziness had a RBC count of 1.63Ã10(6)/Î¼L with 24.0% reticulocytes, an Hb level of 6.0 g/dL, an MCV of 120.2 fL and a WBC count of 3,100/Î¼L with 4.0% myeloblasts. Bone marrow aspirates in both patients confirmed a diagnosis of acute erythroid leukemia (AEL), which can present as marked macrocytic anemia with an MCV in excess of 120 fL and hemolysis.

Social Determinants of Health and the Role of Routine Pediatric Care in a Medically Complex Toddler. Late on a Friday afternoon, a new family presents to your practice for urgent care. They come with their youngest child Mai, a 2-year-old girl, who, although born in the United States at 36 weeks gestation, has resided in Laos with her grandparents for the past 16 months. Your triage nurse tells you that she has a fever and was found to have profound anemia while at the WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) office earlier today.On walking into the room, you describe Mai as "listless" and "sickly." Her vitals were notable for fever (102Â°F), tachycardia (140 beats per minute), and tachypnea (35 breaths per minute). On physical examination, she was grunting with a systolic ejection murmur and without hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory test results revealed hemoglobin of 2.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 12%, mean corpuscular volume of 50 fL, red cell distribution width of 27%, reticulocyte count of 3%, ferritin of &lt;2 ng/mL, iron of 15 Î¼g/dL, total iron binding count of 420 Î¼g/dL, white blood cell count of 13.5 K/Î¼L, and platelets of 605 K/Î¼L. Her evaluation was consistent with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA), which was further supported by reported restrictive diet and excessive cow milk intake of 35 ounces daily. She was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in high-output cardiac failure and was slowly transfused with 15 mL/kg of packed red blood cells over 2 days with careful monitoring. Once stabilized, she was transferred to the inpatient floor for further nutritional evaluation and supplementation. Additional workup, including hemoglobin electrophoresis, fecal occult blood test, celiac studies, and stool parasite testing were normal. The clinical picture was consistent with a viral infection in the setting of profound IDA and malnutrition.Although her clinical status had improved, she remained inpatient for nutritional optimization. Her height was at the 54th percentile (z-score: 0.11), weight was at the first percentile (z-score: -2.25), and body mass index was below the first percentile (z-score: -3.18), diagnostic of severe protein-calorie malnutrition. She was evaluated by an interdisciplinary growth and nutrition team, received multivitamin and mineral supplements, and was monitored for refeeding syndrome. She was noted to be "difficult to engage," "resistant to new faces," and made little progress on expanding her dietary choices. Concerns about a possible diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder were raised by her treating team. What would you do next? 1. Bouma S.

Critical evaluation of peripheral smear in cases of anemia with high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration in children: a series of four cases. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), a parameter that is reported as a part of a standard complete blood count by automated analyzer, is a measure of the concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cell. Values of MCHC significantly above reference range are not physiologically possible due to limitations on solubility of hemoglobin. The high MCHC can give us a clue to certain type of hemolytic anemia and necessitate critical evaluation of peripheral smear to reach a definitive diagnosis. Here we are presenting a series of four cases with raised MCHC, emphasizing the importance of systematic and meticulous examination of the peripheral smear to render a definitive diagnosis.

Context:
An interesting case of pachydermoperiostosis with idiopathic myelofibrosis associated with monosomy 22. A 24-year-old man was referred to our clinic in August 2003 with complaints of weakness, dizziness, and bilateral knee pain of 3 years' duration. Bilateral digital clubbing had been found on routine physical examination during his military service 4 years earlier. There were no cardiorespiratory or abdominal symptoms. There was no compromise in the activities of everyday life. The patient was not a chronic smoker. In the family history of the patient, his brother had been diagnosed with pachydermoperiostosis in another center 2 years earlier, but did not return to the hospital for a follow-up investigation of myelofibrosis. On physical examination, the patient showed marked drumstick clubbing of the hands (Fig. 1), and a pale general appearance. The causes of digital clubbing are shown in Table 1 (Fawcett RS, Linford S, Stulberg DL. Nail abnormalities: clues to systemic disease. Am Fam Physician 2004; 69: 1417-1424). Deep nasolabial folds were seen on the face. Skin hypertrophy, cutis verticis gyrata, and seborrhea on the face were also observed. The patient also complained of hyperhidrosis. Examination of the cardiovascular system was normal. There was bilateral swelling of the ankle and knee (Fig. 2). Hepatosplenomegaly was found on abdominal examination. Investigations showed hypochromic microcytic anemia [hemoglobin, 8.58 g/dL (normal, 12.2-18.1 g/dL); hematocrit, 28.1% (normal, 37.7-53.7%); white blood cell count, 3430/mm(3) (normal, 4600-10,200/mm(3)); neutrophils, 2470/mm(3) (normal, 2000-6900/mm(3)); lymphocytes, 820/mm(3) (normal, 600-3400/mm(3)); platelets, 162,000/mm(3) (normal, 142,000-424,000 mm(3)); mean corpuscular volume, 73.7 fL (normal, 80-97 fL)]. Anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, microcytosis, and hypochromia were observed on peripheral blood examination, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 37 mm/h. The serum C-reactive protein level was 50.1 mg/L (normal, 0-5 mg/L). Biochemical parameters, including serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphates and liver function tests, were found to be within the normal range. The causes of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with pulmonary, rheumatologic, endocrine, cardiac, and gastroenterologic disorders were excluded. Growth hormone level and thyroid function tests were normal. Antinuclear antibody, TORCH [Toxoplasma immunoglobulin M (IgM), rubella IgM, cytomegalovirus IgM, herpes simplex IgM] panel, and markers of hepatitis were negative. Serum Igs and rheumatoid factor were found to be within the normal range. There was subperiosteal new bone formation on bilateral knee X-ray (Fig. 3). Radiography of the chest, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas, and echocardiography were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Amyloid deposition was not determined in rectal biopsy. Reticulin-type myelofibrosis was found on bone marrow biopsy (Figs 4 and 5). In the cytogenetic study, monosomy 22 was detected in four of 20 metaphase plates.


Anemia associated with new-onset diabetes: improvement with blood glucose control. To evaluate the mild normochromic normocytic anemia associated with new-onset diabetes in young, otherwise healthy patients. We undertook a retrospective review of medical records of patients with new-onset diabetes and unexplained anemia. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 12.5 g/dL in women and less than 14 g/dL in men. Patients with obvious causes of anemia, such as renal insufficiency, infection, pancreatitis, deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemolysis, or acute or chronic blood loss, were excluded from the study. In 16 otherwise seemingly healthy patients with new-onset diabetes, a normochromic normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 86.4 +/- 4 fL) was diagnosed at initial assessment. These 16 patients (8 men and 8 women) had a mean age of 33 +/- 10 years. At diagnosis, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 15.5 +/- 3.4%, the mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.5 +/- 0.6 g/dL, and the mean hematocrit was 36.2 +/- 2%. All patients were treated with insulin. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 +/- 17 months, insulin treatment resulted in a decline in HbA1c to 7.7 +/- 1.7% (P&lt;0.001; confidence interval [CI], 5.7 to 9.8). The hemoglobin concentration increased to 14.3 +/- 0.9 g/dL (P&lt;0.001; CI, 1.22 to 2.38), and the hematocrit increased to 42.1 +/- 1.9% (P&lt;0.001; CI, 3.59 to 7.04). All patients had hemoglobin AA and normal levels of hemoglobin A2. Men and women had equal improvement in hematologic variables after improvement in glycemic control. Some patients with new-onset diabetes have a mild normochromic normocytic anemia that is not attributable to usual causes, such as infection, pancreatitis, or blood loss. Improvement in glycemic control tends to be associated with normalization of hemoglobin levels. The cause of such cases of anemia may be either direct "glucose toxicity" to erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow or perhaps oxidative stress to mature erythrocytes.

Two cases of acute erythroid leukemia presenting with marked macrocytic anemia, reticulocytosis and hemolysis. Case 1. The laboratory findings of a hematological analysis of a 53-year-old woman with palpitations and dyspnea revealed the following: red blood cell (RBC) count: 9.4Ã10(5)/Î¼L with 60.0â° reticulocytes; Hb: 3.7 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 124.5 fL; white blood cell (WBC) count: 2,800/Î¼L with 10.0% myeloblasts. Case 2. Similarly, a 42-year-old man with dizziness had a RBC count of 1.63Ã10(6)/Î¼L with 24.0% reticulocytes, an Hb level of 6.0 g/dL, an MCV of 120.2 fL and a WBC count of 3,100/Î¼L with 4.0% myeloblasts. Bone marrow aspirates in both patients confirmed a diagnosis of acute erythroid leukemia (AEL), which can present as marked macrocytic anemia with an MCV in excess of 120 fL and hemolysis.

[Fever, large eyes and confusion; the anticholinergic syndrome]. A 52-year-old woman was in a confused state and had difficulty walking and swallowing, as well as dysarthria. That same day she had consumed some berries, which she thought were bilberries, but she had instead eaten Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). She made a spontaneous and full recovery within a few days. A 3-year-old boy, with amblyopia, was vomiting, had difficulty walking and had a temperature of 39 degrees C. He was agitated and had a warm, red skin and dilated pupils that did not respond to light. A suspected intoxication with a parasympathicolytic agent was confirmed upon an empty bottle of atropine eye drops being found at his home. The boy made a full recovery following treatment with physostigmine. It is important to consider an anticholinergenic intoxication in the case of patients who are confused, have difficulty speaking, large fixed pupils and fever. A specific anamnesis with respect to medicines, eye drops and berries or plants consumed can confirm the diagnosis. It is important to recognise an anticholinergic intoxication because without treatment, the outcome can be fatal.

[Etiology of initially unexplained confusion of excitability in deadly nightshade poisoning with suicidal intent. Symptoms, differential diagnosis, toxicology and physostigmine therapy of anticholinergic syndrome]. After a walk in a wood a 55-year-old teacher was admitted to the emergency unit of a university hospital because of somnolence and excitability. Her rectal temperature was 37.8 degrees C, she had sinus tachycardia (rate of 130/min) but no other significant findings. With the exception of C-reactive protein (10 mg/dl), MCV (101 fl), MCH (34 pg) and arterial blood gases (pH 7.483, pCO2 35.5 mmHg, base excess 5.1 mmp/l) laboratory tests were within normal limits. Qualitative screening of serum for benzodiazepines, barbiturates and antidepressives was negative. Neurological examination, including lumbar puncture and cranial computed tomography were noncontributory. 10 hours after admission the patient developed signs of an anticholinergic syndrome with mydriasis, dry mouth, tachycardia, hot skin and an atonic bladder. Physostigmine 2 mg completely reversed the neurological and mental symptoms. After gas chromatography, mass-spectrometry of a urine sample showed an atropine molecular fragment with a molecular weight of 271. At intervals of 3 to 5 hours the recurrence of confusion and excitability required 4 further i.v. injection of physostigmine. The patient subsequently became accessible to psychiatric examination and reported that during the walk she had swallowed 8-10 berries of deadly nightshade with suicidal intent. In case of excitability and confusion as well as somnolence or coma of uncertain aetiology an anticholinergic syndrome caused by ingestion of atropine-containing plants or psychoactive drugs (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants) should be included in the differential diagnosis. If there are suggestive clinical findings (tachycardia, somnolence, coma or threatened respiratory arrest, physostigmine should be given if there are no contraindications.

Treatment of acute anticholinergic poisoning with physostigmine. Five cases of acute anticholinergic poisoning presenting to an inner-city emergency department (ED) are discussed. All five patients presented with classic signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity, which included tachycardia, hot, dry and flushed skin, markedly dilated and fixed pupils, and pronounced delirium. The patients were violently agitated, and physical restraint was required. Initial treatment with benzodiazepines did not diminish their combative behavior. Treatment with intravenous physostigmine salicylate resulted in a decrease in agitation within 15 to 20 minutes of therapy. No untoward effects occurred as a result of treatment with physostigmine.

Altered mental status from olanzapine overdose treated with physostigmine. Olanzapine is commonly prescribed to patients with schizophrenia. One retrospective study demonstrates the efficacy of physostigmine in reversing mental status changes induced by olanzapine. We report two patients with delirium due to confirmed olanzapine overdose treated with physostigmine. One patient's mental status transiently returned to normal. The other patient completely recovered. CASE 1: A 25-year-old man ingested 300 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, he was agitated, delirious, tachycardic, had dry skin and mucous membranes, and dilated pupils (6 mm) minimally reactive to light. Physostigmine, 0.5 mg, was given intravenously (IV) without effect. Additional physostigmine doses of 1.5 mg IV administered 5 minutes later and then 1 mg IV resulted in the patient having a clear sensorium and normal mentation. The patient's mental status continued to remain normal for the duration of his hospital stay. Olanzapine was identified in the urine by high performance liquid chromatography. CASE 2: A 20-year-old female ingested 600 mg of olanzapine. On presentation, she was tachycardic, obtunded, and minimally responsive to painful stimuli, with decreased bowel sounds, dry skin and dry mucous membranes. Physostigmine, 2 mg, was given IV. Shortly thereafter she regained full consciousness and began speaking coherently. She remained in this condition for approximately 30 minutes, and then became obtunded. Her serum olanzapine concentration was 1230 ng/mL. No further doses of physostigmine were administered. On day 3 of admission her mental status returned to normal. We report two cases of olanzapine-induced mental status changes treated with physostigmine. The utility of physostigmine as a safe or necessary antidote in the setting of olanzapine overdose remains to be determined.

Successful management of olanzapine-induced anticholinergic agitation and delirium with a continuous intravenous infusion of physostigmine in a pediatric patient. Physostigmine effectively reverses anticholinergic delirium. However, continuous IV infusion of physostigmine is rarely used due to concern for cardiotoxicity and signs of cholinergic excess such as seizures, nausea, and vomiting. We report the successful use of continuous IV physostigmine in a 6-year-old boy with anticholinergic delirium. A 6-year-old, 30-kg boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ingested 15-20 olanzapine (5 mg) tablets. He was agitated and was treated with lorazepam at a local hospital. His heart rate was 148 beats per min; respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; blood pressure, 111/70 mmHg; temperature, 96.8Â°F, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. His pupils were 5-6 mm, and his skin was warm and initially flushed. Blood chemistry results were normal. A 12-lead ECG showed sinus tachycardia with normal QRS and QT intervals. The agitation worsened and did not respond to benzodiazepines. The patient was then given a dose of 0.6 mg physostigmine (0.02 mg/kg) intravenously with reversal of the agitation. But the effect only lasted 45 min requiring administration of a second bolus of 0.6 mg (0.02 mg/kg). A physostigmine intravenous infusion was administered at a rate of 0.5 mg/h (0.0167 mg/kg/h). Overnight, the patient became more agitated. The physostigmine was discontinued, and IV dexmedetomidine (0.2 Î¼g/kg/h) was started at 21:00. The patient became over-sedated with pinpoint pupils resulting in discontinuation of the dexmedetomidine at 04:00. The patient again became agitated and developed visual hallucinations. Three 1-mg (0.03 mg/kg) boluses of physostigmine were administered over 45 min, and the physostigmine infusion was restarted at a rate of 1 mg/h (0.03 mg/kg/h) for 16.5 h. He received 19.5 mg of physostigmine with no return of anticholinergic symptoms and no signs of cholinergic excess except for a tremor that resolved when the infusion was stopped. He was discharged home without further sequelae. There are few publications describing a continuous infusion of physostigmine to reverse anticholinergic delirium. Our patient received a total dose of 25.5 mg with complete resolution of symptoms. We report the successful use of continuous infusion of physostigmine to reverse anticholinergic delirium in a pediatric patient who unintentionally ingested olanzapine.

Context:
[Fever, large eyes and confusion; the anticholinergic syndrome]. A 52-year-old woman was in a confused state and had difficulty walking and swallowing, as well as dysarthria. That same day she had consumed some berries, which she thought were bilberries, but she had instead eaten Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). She made a spontaneous and full recovery within a few days. A 3-year-old boy, with amblyopia, was vomiting, had difficulty walking and had a temperature of 39 degrees C. He was agitated and had a warm, red skin and dilated pupils that did not respond to light. A suspected intoxication with a parasympathicolytic agent was confirmed upon an empty bottle of atropine eye drops being found at his home. The boy made a full recovery following treatment with physostigmine. It is important to consider an anticholinergenic intoxication in the case of patients who are confused, have difficulty speaking, large fixed pupils and fever. A specific anamnesis with respect to medicines, eye drops and berries or plants consumed can confirm the diagnosis. It is important to recognise an anticholinergic intoxication because without treatment, the outcome can be fatal.


[Etiology of initially unexplained confusion of excitability in deadly nightshade poisoning with suicidal intent. Symptoms, differential diagnosis, toxicology and physostigmine therapy of anticholinergic syndrome]. After a walk in a wood a 55-year-old teacher was admitted to the emergency unit of a university hospital because of somnolence and excitability. Her rectal temperature was 37.8 degrees C, she had sinus tachycardia (rate of 130/min) but no other significant findings. With the exception of C-reactive protein (10 mg/dl), MCV (101 fl), MCH (34 pg) and arterial blood gases (pH 7.483, pCO2 35.5 mmHg, base excess 5.1 mmp/l) laboratory tests were within normal limits. Qualitative screening of serum for benzodiazepines, barbiturates and antidepressives was negative. Neurological examination, including lumbar puncture and cranial computed tomography were noncontributory. 10 hours after admission the patient developed signs of an anticholinergic syndrome with mydriasis, dry mouth, tachycardia, hot skin and an atonic bladder. Physostigmine 2 mg completely reversed the neurological and mental symptoms. After gas chromatography, mass-spectrometry of a urine sample showed an atropine molecular fragment with a molecular weight of 271. At intervals of 3 to 5 hours the recurrence of confusion and excitability required 4 further i.v. injection of physostigmine. The patient subsequently became accessible to psychiatric examination and reported that during the walk she had swallowed 8-10 berries of deadly nightshade with suicidal intent. In case of excitability and confusion as well as somnolence or coma of uncertain aetiology an anticholinergic syndrome caused by ingestion of atropine-containing plants or psychoactive drugs (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, tri- or tetracyclic antidepressants) should be included in the differential diagnosis. If there are suggestive clinical findings (tachycardia, somnolence, coma or threatened respiratory arrest, physostigmine should be given if there are no contraindications.

Treatment of acute anticholinergic poisoning with physostigmine. Five cases of acute anticholinergic poisoning presenting to an inner-city emergency department (ED) are discussed. All five patients presented with classic signs and symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity, which included tachycardia, hot, dry and flushed skin, markedly dilated and fixed pupils, and pronounced delirium. The patients were violently agitated, and physical restraint was required. Initial treatment with benzodiazepines did not diminish their combative behavior. Treatment with intravenous physostigmine salicylate resulted in a decrease in agitation within 15 to 20 minutes of therapy. No untoward effects occurred as a result of treatment with physostigmine.

Question:
A 35-year-old G1 is brought to the emergency department because of sharp pains in her abdomen. She is at 30 weeks gestation based on ultrasound. She complains of  feeling a little uneasy during the last 3 weeks of her pregnancy. She mentions that her abdomen has not been enlarging as expected and her baby is not moving as much as during the earlier part of the pregnancy. If anything, she noticed her abdomen has decreased in size. While she is giving her history, the emergency medicine physician notices that she is restless and is sweating profusely. An ultrasound is performed and her blood is sent for type and match. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 120/min, and the respiratory rate  is 18/min. The fetal ultrasound is significant for no fetal heart motion or fetal movement. Her blood work shows the following: hemoglobin, 10.3 g/dL; platelet count, 1.1*10(5)/ml; bleeding time, 10 minutes; PT, 25 seconds; and PTT, 45 seconds.

Secondary abdominal pregnancy in a Jehovah's Witness. A 35-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, aborta 0, arrived at our emergency department with abdominal pain of more than 2 weeks' duration. Diagnostic pelvic ultrasonography confirmed a 16-week intra-abdominal pregnancy. Hemoglobin level was 6.9 mg/dL, and hematocrit value was 20.1%. The patient refused blood transfusion on religious grounds. Laparotomy revealed 2,000 mL of blood in the abdomen and a live fetus, with the placenta attached to the omentum and the serosal surface of the right fallopian tube. Postoperative hemoglobin level was 2.8 mg/dL. The patient was transferred to another facility for hyperbaric oxygen therapy, where she subsequently died. Abdominal pregnancy is rare, but has high fetal and maternal mortality rates. Our patient's case was complicated, since she was a Jehovah's Witness and refused lifesaving treatment on religious grounds. Serious medical decisions were made, while respecting the autonomy of the patient.

Sigmoid volvulus in pregnancy. A 27-year-old woman, gravida 1, was seen at our surgical emergency department with abdominal pain at 25 weeks' gestation. She had pain, nausea and vomiting, a temperature of 37Â°C and a blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg. The cervix was closed, and an ultrasound scan showed a normal single fetus. A plain abdominal radiograph showed distension of the colon and a sigmoid volvulus. At emergency laparotomy, non-gangrenous sigmoid colon was resected with primary anastomosis. There were no complications, and 4 months later the patient delivered a healthy infant.  Early diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus in pregnancy and prompt intervention minimise maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

Context:
A pregnant woman with acute abdomen. Acute abdomen in pregnancy is challenging. The presentation of symptoms and available diagnostic tools are directed and complicated by the pregnancy. A rare cause of acute abdomen in pregnancy requiring immediate intervention is presented. A primiparous woman with 34 weeks of uncomplicated pregnancy presented with acute onset of abdominal pain, no signs of labour or vaginal bleeding, blood pressure 127/100, and pulse 90. No fetal distress was indicated by cardiotocography or abdominal ultrasound, while large amounts of intra-abdominal free fluid were identified. The clinical examination revealed free intra-abdominal fluid, which combined with the intense pain prompted an emergency caesarean section on vital indication with removal of intra-abdominal blood, immediate delivery, and manual compression of the aorta. No signs of placental abruption or rupture of the uterine wall were identified. The bleeding, originating from a spontaneous rupture of the left uterine vein, was halted by vessel ligation. Although haemodynamically stable, the woman's estimated blood loss was 4700Â millilitres. The child remained for ten days in the NICU owing to prematurity. A total of 100 case reports of acute spontaneous haemoperitoneum during pregnancy have been published. The underlying pathophysiology is undetermined, but possible risk factors include nulliparity, endometriosis causing extrauterine bleeding, and varicose veins. The condition requires immediate intervention, as morbidity and mortality rates for mother and fetus are high.

Her laboratory tests showed a decreased hemoglobin concentration of 8.9 g/dL (normal range, 12-16 g/dL), a decreased platelet count of 45 Ã 10



Question:
A 35-year-old G1 is brought to the emergency department because of sharp pains in her abdomen. She is at 30 weeks gestation based on ultrasound. She complains of  feeling a little uneasy during the last 3 weeks of her pregnancy. She mentions that her abdomen has not been enlarging as expected and her baby is not moving as much as during the earlier part of the pregnancy. If anything, she noticed her abdomen has decreased in size. While she is giving her history, the emergency medicine physician notices that she is restless and is sweating profusely. An ultrasound is performed and her blood is sent for type and match. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the pulse is 120/min, and the respiratory rate  is 18/min. The fetal ultrasound is significant for no fetal heart motion or fetal movement. Her blood work shows the following: hemoglobin, 10.3 g/dL; platelet count, 1.1*10(5)/ml; bleeding time, 10 minutes; PT, 25 seconds; and PTT, 45 seconds. Which of the following would be the best immediate course of management for this patient?

[A] : IV fluids
[B] : D-dimer assay
[C] : Fresh frozen plasma
[D] : Low-molecular-weight heparin

Epidural analgesia in labor for a woman with an intrathecal baclofen pump. A 28-year-old woman in active labor at 38 weeks of gestation requested epidural analgesia. She had previously received an intrathecal baclofen infusion pump to relieve the spasticity of cerebral palsy. She had right hemiparesis and cerebral palsy but was otherwise healthy. The patient had been seen one month before her expected delivery date by a staff anesthesiologist. A lumbar X-ray demonstrated the intrathecal catheter entering the L3-4 interspace and extending to the mid-thoracic region. For labor analgesia the epidural space was identified at L4-5 with the patient sitting, using a standard 17-gauge Tuohy needle. An epidural catheter was threaded to 5 cm and provided effective analgesia until delivery four hours later. There were no postnatal complications.

[Autonomic hyperreflexia in tetraplegic pregnant patient: case report]. Complications of pregnant patients with medullary injury include urinary infection, renal stones, anemia, decubitus ulcers, muscle spasms, sepsis, uterine hyperactivity and autonomic hyperreflexia. Autonomic hyperreflexia is the most severe anesthetic complication and should, before all, be prevented. It is often developed in patients with medullary transection at the level of the 5th to 7th thoracic vertebra or above. This report aims at presenting a case of tetraplegic pregnant patient with injury at the level of the 6th cervical vertebra, submitted to Cesarean section under continuous epidural anesthesia with 0.25% bupivacaine without vasoconstrictor associated to fentanyl. Caucasian, tetraplegic primiparous term patient, 39 weeks of gestational age, 22 years old, 63 kg, 168 cm, physical status ASA II, admitted for elective Cesarean section. Patient reported spinomedullary trauma at C6, three years ago. After previous hydration with 1500 ml saline, epidural anesthesia was induced with medial puncture at L3-L4 interspace with the patient in the lateral position, disposable 17G Tuohy needle and without previous local infiltration anesthesia. Immediately after needle insertion, there was adjacent paravertebral muscles contraction, blood pressure increase (BP = 158 x 72 mmHg) and heart rate increase (HR = 90 bpm). Patient, however, did not refer pain. Needle was removed and local anesthesia was induced. Epidural block proceeded with 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine without vasoconstrictor associated to 100 microg spinal fentanyl and epidural catheter insertion in the cephalad direction (3 to 4 cm). Surgery went on without intercurrences with no need for blockade complementation. There were two arterial hypotension episodes in the first 24 postoperative hours, which were treated with lactated Ringers solution. Epidural catheter was maintained for 48 hours. Patient was discharged three days after. For paraplegic or tetraplegic pregnant patients, continuous epidural anesthesia with low local anesthetic concentration without vasoconstrictor and associated to fentanyl is a good indication for instrumented or not vaginal delivery, and Cesarean sections to prevent autonomic hyperreflexia. It is also important that the epidural catheter remains for at least 24 hours after delivery to block sympathetic afference in case a crisis is triggered.

Elective induction of labor conducted under lumbar epidural block. II. Labor induction by amniotomy and intravenous prostaglandin. Labor was electively induced at term in 117 clinically normal nulliparae and parous women by combining low amniotomy with intravenous administration of prostaglandin F2 alpha (n = 64) or prostaglandin E2 (n = 53). Analgesia was obtained by continuous lumbar epidural block with bupivacaine. The procedure was very effective in producing vaginal delivery within 24 h after prostaglandin infusion (n = 115), but it was accompanied by an extremely high incidence of uterine hypertonus. Tentative explanations for the transient uterine hyperstimulation are a direct stimulatory effect of the local anesthetic on the contractility of the myometrial fiber and/or a temporarily higher amount of circulating oxytocic compound reaching the myometrium due to local vasodilatation as a result of sympathetic nerve blockade. In some cases uterine hypertonus was associated with slowing of the basal fetal heart rate and, when severe, with the appearance of late deceleration patterns and fetal acidosis. In other cases the fetal heart rate deceleration is explained by the toxic effect of bupivacaine on the myocard. Since both the myometrial hyperactivity and the FHR alterations were temporary, fetal biochemical parameters were unaffected at completion of the first stage of labor. Because with intravenous prostaglandin uterine hyperstimulation is more difficult to avoid and regional analgesia further increases the hazard of both hypertonus and fetal heart rate deceleration, the combined application of an intravenous prostaglandin and continuous epidural analgesia should not be introduced into obstetrical practice.

Fetal heart rate after epidural lidocaine and bupivacaine for elective cesarean section. This prospective double-blind study was designed to determine whether the fetal heart rate (FHR) changes that have been reported after epidural administration of bupivacaine and lidocaine during labor are present when larger doses of these drugs are given during elective cesarean section. Prior to inserting an epidural catheter, FHR and maternal vital signs were monitored during a control period in 60 healthy term parturients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.1 mEq sodium bicarbonate added to each 20 ml (n = 30) or 2% lidocaine with 1:300,000 epinephrine (n = 30). A 3-ml test dose of the study solution was injected via the catheter and was followed by an additional 17 ml, in increments; additional doses were administered as necessary to obtain surgical anesthesia. FHR and maternal vital signs were monitored for at least 20 min and the characteristics of the anesthetic block noted. At delivery, neonatal status was evaluated, and maternal and cord blood samples were obtained for local anesthetic assays and neonatal blood gases. The groups were similar with respect to maternal characteristics, onset of surgical anesthesia, time to delivery, and uterine incision-delivery interval. Maternal blood pressure decreased from control values in both groups (P less than 0.05), but there was no difference between the groups in either the incidence of hypotension or ephedrine requirements. Analysis of FHR tracings by a perinatologist blinded to the study group revealed no changes after anesthesia and no significant differences between the groups at any time in basal FHR, short- or long-term variability, or the incidence of accelerations or decelerations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Continuous infusion epidural analgesia in parturients receiving bupivacaine, chloroprocaine, or lidocaine--maternal, fetal, and neonatal effects. The effects of epidural analgesia for labor and delivery using a continuous infusion technique on fetal heart rate, uterine activity, maternal blood pressure, Apgar scores, neonatal acid-base status, and the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scoring System were studied in 61 parturients. Group I (n = 23) received initial test and therapeutic doses of 2 and 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine followed by an infusion of 0.125% at a rate of 14 ml/hr. Group II (n = 19) received 2 and 6 ml of 2% chloroprocaine followed by an infusion of 0.75% at a rate of 27 ml/hr. Group III (n = 19) received 2 and 6 ml of 1.5% lidocaine followed by an infusion of 0.75% at a rate of 14 ml/hr. None of the three local anesthetics used had any significant effect on baseline fetal heart rate or uterine activity. In cases in which monitoring of fetal heart rate was both technically satisfactory and continuous, late and variable decelerations in fetal heart rate were seen in 10 of 17, 3 of 18, and 2 of 19 of the fetuses in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The incidence was significantly higher in group I than in groups II or III (P less than 0.05). Apgar scores and neonatal acid-base status were equally good in all three groups. Neurologic and adaptive capacity scores did not differ among the three groups of neonates, nor did any of the neonates in the three groups score lower than a control group of 19 neonates whose mothers did not receive any analgesia or medications for labor and delivery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Comparison of three management strategies for patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, after six months delay: a three-year experience in an Iranian university hospital. A Pap test result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) presents a clinical challenge. Only 5-10% of women with ASCUS harbour serious cervical disease. We screened 3619 women, who attended to Mirza Koochak Khan Hospital at Tehran University of Medical Sciences with Pap smears, of whom 100 returned with ASCUS. After six months, each subject underwent a standard cytology (conventional Pap smear), human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing (identifying high-risk HPV types with polymerase chain reaction) and colposcopy with multiple cervical biopsies. Mean age was 44.09 +/- 8.6 years. The estimated prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II or higher was 4%. When histologically verified high-grade lesions (&gt; or = CIN II) were observed, the relative sensitivity of HPV DNA testing was 100% compared with conventional Pap smear, which performed 75% versus 100% relative sensitivity, respectively, using cytological diagnosis high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) as the cut-off. Negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) of Pap test were 98.9% and 100%. The NPV and PPV of HPV DNA testing were 100%. Although less complicated than colposcopy, the repeat Pap smear triage algorithm for ASCUS may underdiagnose some women with high-grade CIN, when compared with colposcopy. Considering the high sensitivity of HPV testing, it may be useful as an alternative to the current policy of six-month repeat cytology for women with ASCUS results.

Repeated Positive Cervical HPV Testing and Absent or Minor Cytology Abnormality at Pap Smear. What is the Next Step? Human papillomavirus (HPV) screening has significantly reduced cervical cancer (CC) mortality. Women who consecutively test positive for high-risk HPV without and minor changes on reflex cytology (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]) or dysplasia on cervical colposcopy-oriented biopsy are always referred to colposcopy. The aim of the present study was to assess whether this guidance is appropriate for COBAS HPV testing with reflex cytology. A cross-sectional, retrospective study was carried out in 5,227 women who underwent routine CC screening over a period of five years (2012-2017). All HPV tests were performed using CobasÂ®4800 HPV. The study included women attending gynecology appointments whose first HPV test was positive and who had any type of follow-up. Patients' HPV test results as well as cytology and biopsy findings obtained during the abovementioned period were analyzed. A descriptive and comparative statistical study was conducted using this data. A total of 765 out of 6003 HPV tests performed in 5,227 women were positive, and 141 women who had a positive HPV test (with negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy [NILM] or inflammation, or ASC-US and LSIL cytology, but no lesions on colposcopy, or absence of dysplasia on histology) repeated the HPV test at least once. Of these 141 women, 6 were diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) during the follow-up period. All cases of HSIL were diagnosed after the second HPV test. This study shows that, at cervical cancer screening, all women testing positive for HPV regardless of Pap smear result should be referred to colposcopy.

Implications regarding atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance among women residing in a US-Mexico border city. We conducted a study of Mexican American women living in a US-Mexico border city who attended a gynecology clinic for Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. The objective of this study was to describe the cytologic outcomes of women who had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) diagnosis after a Pap smear and to observe any changes during follow-up colposcopy. A total of 852 abnormal Pap smear were identified through a computer search for a 6-month period. Histology data were available for 317 cases. Benign findings were observed in 45.4% of cervical biopsies. A clinically significant diagnosis was reported in the remaining tissue sample. The diagnosis report was either single or combined and recorded as follows: human papilloma virus 46.3%, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 23.6%; CIN 2, 5.6%; and CIN 3, 1.5%. There was one case of invasive cervical cancer. Overall, the incidence rate of ASCUS was 5%. However, we found that a significant proportion of this population had CIN 1 through CIN 3. Furthermore, this population has traditionally been noncompliant and routinely failed to attend follow-up appointments. Based on these results, the clinician should not ignore an initial abnormal Pap smear. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to perform colposcopy in Mexican American patients with a first time diagnosis of ASCUS on routine Pap smear.

Colposcopy Requirement of Papanicolaou Smear after Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US) by Follow-up Protocol in an Urban Gynaecology Clinic, a Retrospective Study in Thailand. ASC-US cases are managed according to the current American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guideline in which a human papillomavirus (HPV) test and repeat Pap smear are performed in the next 1 year. Colposcopy in cases of positive high risk HPV and persistent ASC-US or more in subsequent Pap smear is recommended. The HPV test is more expensive and still not currently a routine practice in Thailand. To identify the risk factors of persisted abnormal Pap smear and the colposcopic requirement rate in women with ASC-US. During 2008-2013, this study was conducted in Prapokklao Hospital, Chanthaburi, Thailand. Participants were women who attended gynaecology clinic for cervical cancer screening. Women who had cytological reports with ASC-US were recruited. During the study period, 503 cases were enrolled. Colposcopic requirement was defined as those who were detected with an ASC-US or more in subsequent Pap smears up to 1 year follow-up. The colposcopic referral rate was 23.2 (85/365) percent at 12 months. Prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 was 3.3 (12/365) percent. Loss follow-up rate of subsequent Pap smear and colposcopic appointment were 27.4 (138/503) and 48.2 (41/85) percent, respectively. There was no invasive cancer. High risk factors for persisted abnormal Pap smears in subsequent test were premenopausal status, HIV infected patients and non-oral contraceptive pills (COC) users. Referral rate for colposcopy in women with ASC-US reports was rather high. Loss to follow-up rate was the major limitation. Immediate colposcopy should be offered for women who had high risk for silent CIN.

Follow-up of Papanicolaou smears diagnosed as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. In the first year since the institution of the Bethesda system at UCDMC, 549/7,388 (7.43%) Papanicolaou (Pap) smears were diagnosed as having an epithelial abnormality. One hundred ninety-three of the 549 (35.1%) of the abnormal smears received an ASCUS diagnosis, representing 2.61% of the total volume. Follow-up was obtained on 124/193 (64.2%) and consisted of colposcopy with biopsy in 38.3%, one repeat Pap smear in 51.2%, and two or more repeat Pap smears in 10.5%. Follow-up revealed a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL) in 29.1%, ASCUS in 12.9%, and no evidence of an epithelial lesion in 58.0%. Review of the original ASCUS Pap smear from the group with no epithelial lesion on follow-up showed increased inflammation plus metaplasia and/or reactive changes in 69.5% and ASCUS in 19.5%. This study demonstrates that a significant percentage of ASCUS Pap smears represent SIL. However, many Pap smears with reactive, inflammatory changes are misclassified as ASCUS and would be best diagnosed under "Reactive/Reparative Changes" in the Bethesda system. Careful attention to criteria for ASCUS and inflammatory and reactive atypia is recommended to avoid misclassification and to make this category more meaningful to the clinician.

The utility of high-risk HPV testing in the management of women 30 to 64 years of age with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions on cervical cytology. The current American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines recommend high risk-human papillomavirus testing for patients 30 to 64 years of age with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion on Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. This study presents our experience since the introduction of the new guidelines. From September 1, 2013 through August 31, 2014, 20,014 ThinPrep Pap tests were processed, of which 17,989 (90%) were negative, 863 (4.3%) were atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), and 540 (2.7%) were low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). Thirty-eight percent of the negative cases, 87% of the ASCUS cases, and 76% of the LSIL cases were processed for high risk-human papillomavirus genotypes. Of the 1,163 patients with a Pap test diagnosis of ASCUS and LSIL, 656 (56%) underwent colposcopic examination and, of those, 240 (37%) had cervical biopsies performed. In our cohort, 247 (33%) of the 754 ASCUS Pap tests were hr-HPV-positive and 507 (67%) were hr-HPV-negative. Of the 409 LSIL Pap tests, 245 (60%) were hr-HPV-positive and 164 (40%) were hr-HPV-negative. Colposcopy/biopsy follow-up within 3-months of the ThinPrep Pap test showed cervical intraepithelial lesion grade 2/3 lesions in 16% of the hr-HPV-positive ASCUS cases, in 15% of the hr-HPV-positive LSIL cases and in 9% of the hr-HPV-negative LSIL cases. This study supports the current management guidelines of colposcopy for women 30 to 64 years of age with hr-HPV-positive ASCUS and LSIL on Pap tests and repeat Pap test with cotesting for women with hr-HPV-negative LSIL.




Question:
A 64-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months.

Five-year risks of CIN 3+ and cervical cancer among women with HPV testing of ASC-US Pap results. New screening guidelines recommend that human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative/atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) results be considered as equivalent to HPV-negative/Pap-negative results, leading to rescreening in 5 years. However, despite ample data, the routine clinical performance of HPV testing of women with ASC-US has not been adequately documented. We estimated 5-year risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3+ and of cancer among 2 groups of women between 2003 and 2010 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California: 27,050 aged 30 to 64 years who underwent HPV and Pap cotesting and had an ASC-US Pap result and 12,209 aged 25 to 29 years who underwent HPV triage of ASC-US. Five-year risks of CIN 3+ and of cancer among women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-negative/ASC-US and among 923,152 women testing Pap-negative alone were similar although statistically distinguishable (CIN 3+, 0.43% vs 0.26%, p = .001; cancer, 0.050% vs 0.025%, p = .1). The increased risk of cancer after HPV-negative/ASC-US versus Pap-negative alone was confined to women aged 60 to 64 years (0.26% vs 0.035%, p = .3). Five-year risks of CIN 3+ and cancer among women with HPV-negative/ASC-US results were substantially higher than those among women testing HPV-negative/Pap-negative (CIN 3+, 0.43% vs 0.08%, p &lt; .0001; cancer, 0.050% vs 0.011%, p = .003). For women aged 30 to 64 years testing HPV-positive/ASC-US, 5-year risks of CIN 3+ and cancer were slightly higher than those among 9,374 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (CIN 3+, 6.8% vs 5.2%, p = .0007; cancer, 0.41% vs 0.16%, p = .04). Similar patterns were seen for women aged 25 to 29 years. Women with HPV-negative/ASC-US had a similar risk as women testing Pap-negative alone but had a higher risk than women testing HPV-negative/Pap-negative. Based upon the principle of "equal management of equal risks," our findings support the equal management of women with HPV-negative/ASC-US and those with Pap-negative alone, except for exiting women from screening because cancer risks at ages 60 to 64 years may be higher for women testing HPV-negative/ASC-US. Our findings also support managing HPV-positive/ASC-US and LSIL similarly.

Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance : A Follow up Study. Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) is the term in cervical cytology reporting where the changes are suggestive of a sqamous extraepithelial lesion but lack criteria for definition interpretation. Its clinical significance is variable. A one year study in a zonal hospital evaluating all cervical smears received for cytology by two pathologists independently and subsequently reported as per the Bethesda guidelines. The patients were folloed up for six months. A total of 24 (4%) smears were reported as ASCUS out of 604 examined. Of these, 15 were followed up for one year. Mean age was 39 years and 60% were premenopausal. After six months, 11 cases were reported negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy and four showed ASCUS on repeat pap smear. ASCUS shows a repression rate of 73%. Colpscopic evaluation should be done only if ASCUS persists. Diligent follow up and biopsy, when indicated is a must.

Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance: a comparative review of original and automated rescreen diagnosis of cervicovaginal smears with long term follow-up. There is an increasing number of articles regarding the long term follow-up of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears with the diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Much controversy exists regarding the management of patients with this diagnosis. In a prior study in 1992, the authors performed automated rescreening of 101 ASCUS cases and 91 negative (control) cases. They found that through PAPNET-directed rescreening, 35 of 101 ASCUS cases (35%) could be reclassified as a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). These 192 women were followed since 1992 through manual look backs of subsequent Pap smears and surgical biopsies over a 4-year period. The population studied was comprised of predominantly black women between the ages of 14 and 85 years. The majority were considered a high risk population because many had a history of several sexual partners and multiple pregnancies. Eighteen of 74 patients (24.3%) with an original diagnosis of ASCUS were found on subsequent Pap smears to have an SIL. Only 4 of 64 patients (6%) who originally had a negative Pap smear subsequently were found to have a low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) within 4 years. Through ordinal logistic regression analysis, it was found that patients with an ASCUS diagnosis had a risk of developing SIL that was 2.6 times greater than the risk for patients with a negative smear diagnosis. Comparing the surgical biopsies in the control and ASCUS groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of developing SIL. This may be because the number of follow-up biopsies were small. A statistically significant difference of the risk of developing SIL exists between patients with a negative smear versus those with an ASCUS smear. Long term follow-up is essential in the management of the patients with an ASCUS smear because there is clearly an increased risk of developing SIL.

Triage of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US): results of an Italian multicentric study. To compare the performance of immediate colposcopy, repeat Pap test and HPV test as triage options for women diagnosed as having atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) while attending organised screening for cervical carcinoma in five centres of the Veneto region. Women consecutively diagnosed as having ASC-US were included in a prospective study, and underwent colposcopy and collection of cervico-vaginal cells for conventional Pap test and HPV test (Hybrid Capture 2, High-risk probe set, Digene). Repetition of all three tests was scheduled for 12 months later. DNA was subsequently extracted from residual cells of positive samples, and analysed by polymerase chain reaction with several primers for typing of HPV sequences. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the different triage options for histology-confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) were calculated among all women and by age (under and above 35 years). Seven hundred forty-nine women 25-64 years old (median age 42 years) were enrolled in the study. Pap smears at enrolment were read as ASC-US or more severe in 211 (29.4%) cases, colposcopy disclosed an atypical transformation zone in 254 (34.2%) women, and HPV test was positive in 181 (24.2%). High-grade cervical lesions developed in 29/749 (3.9%) women. HPV typing was possible in 163 (90%) of the samples, and carcinogenic types were present in 123. HPV test showed the best performance; overall, it had the highest sensitivity (92.3%), specificity (78.6%) and PPV (14.9%).

Context:
Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of a Middle-Third Clavicle Fracture with a Superior Plate. Open reduction and internal fixation has become a reliable technique to treat complex middle-third clavicle fractures (AO/OTA B-15). Nonoperative treatment of these fractures may result in higher rates of symptomatic malunion, nonunion, dissatisfaction with cosmetic appearance, and even dysfunction and muscular weakness. Risk factors such as substantial displacement or comminution, far lateral fractures, fractures in the elderly, open fractures, or those occurring in polytrauma scenarios are appropriate indications for surgery. The aim of the procedure is to reconstitute the initial curvature and length of the clavicle, restore a normal connection from the arm to the axial skeleton, and provide stable fixation of the proximal and distal fragments, to allow an immediate full range of motion during rehabilitation. The procedure includes the following steps. Step 1: Place the patient in a beach-chair, semi-sitting position.Step 2: Make a transverse skin incision along the anteroinferior aspect of the clavicle.Step 3: Expose the fracture site, identify and prepare the fragments unless they are comminuted, and preserve soft-tissue attachments to the extent possible.Step 4: Reduce the fragments by direct or indirect manipulation, and maintain the reduction with clamps, Kirschner wires, or mini-fragment plates. Consider bridging comminuted zones to allow secondary fracture-healing.Step 5: Apply a contoured plate to the superior or anterior surface of the clavicle, and obtain at least 6 cortices of fixation on each side with strategic nonlocking and locking screws. The working length of the plate is more important than the number of screws or cortices.Step 6: Obtain a single intraoperative anteroposterior radiograph of the clavicle.Step 7: Separately close the wound in layers (deltotrapezial fascia, platysma, and skin). Apply sterile dressings and a sling. The patient is discharged home on the same day if the injury is isolated, and a full range of motion of the affected shoulder is allowed immediately. The patient is expected to regain full function and strength of the arm once healing occurs.

[Middle third clavicle fractures--diagnosis, complications and treatment]. Clavicle fractures compose 2.5% to 5% of all fractures, and usually occur due to a direct blow to the shoulder. The incidence of these fractures persistently increases. Most of the fractures are in the middle third--a result of the unique structure of the clavicle and its ligamentous and muscular attachments. The fracture diagnosis includes focused physical examination, radiographic evaluation, and comprehensive evaluation of the patient, considering the fact that the fracture can be the result of significant energy absorption and can hide other injuries. Usually treatment is non-operative, and results in fracture union of 95%. Healing is achieved with a certain amount of deformity. The most common treatment is a sling or figure-of-8 dressing worn for several weeks. When absolute surgical indications (open fracture or neurovascular injury) or relative surgical indications (multiple injuries or floating shoulder) exist, several surgical procedures can be chosen. The fracture displacement as a predictive factor for union or function after healing is controversial. Complications associated with clavicle fractures are the result of either conservative or surgical treatment. The most common complication is an esthetic defect. Other complications are non-union, mal-union, limited range of motion and neurovascular injury.

Clavicle nonunion in a 10-year-old boy. Posttraumatic clavicle nonunion is rare, particularly in children. Four cases of clavicle fracture nonunion in patients aged 10 years and younger have been reported. A variety of techniques have been used to treat pediatric clavicle nonunions. A 10-year-old boy presented to our institution after a fall, sustaining a right closed midshaft clavicle fracture. No other injuries occurred, and neurovascular examination of the right upper extremity was normal. The fracture was initially treated with a sling for &gt;4 months, and the fracture progressed to a hypertrophic nonunion. Serial radiographs failed to demonstrate progression to union. The patient continued to have pain with activity 4 months after his injury. Clavicle pseudarthrosis was considered; however, radiographs did not have the characteristic appearance of this condition. This fracture nonunion was treated with internal fixation and united with no complication. The patient was back to full activities of daily living 6 months postoperatively. He reported no tenderness at the fracture site or along the hardware. The treating surgeon (A.M.S.) prefers to remove hardware in young children, but the family declined removal. Pediatric posttraumatic nonunion of the clavicle is rare but can be safely treated with plate fixation, with excellent results.

Proximal clavicle physeal fracture with posterior displacement: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Posterior sternoclavicular fracture displacement can present as a posterior sternoclavicular joint dislocation and is rare in the pediatric population. This article provides an algorithm for evaluation and management.A 14-year-old boy with a previously undiagnosed posterior sternoclavicular displacement presented with persistent 7/10 shoulder pain extending into his neck after undergoing nonoperative treatment for an unconfirmed diagnosis at another emergency department. Plain radiographs revealed a displacement of the right medial clavicle, and the position of the clavicular head indicated advanced imaging. Computed tomography showed the posterior portion of the clavicular head butting against the left braciocephalic vein at its confluence with the superior vena cava. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation. After exposing the sternoclavicular joint, a Salter-Harris I fracture with no evidence of vascular injury was confirmed. The fracture was reduced and stabilized using figure-eight #5 Ethibond sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey), and the patient was placed in an immobilizer for 1 week. At 1 year postoperatively, the patient regained full range of motion and was completely healed.Posterior clavicle displacements are potentially devastating injuries that are difficult to diagnose. Coordinating operative treatment with orthopedic and general surgery is indicated to manage the fracture or displacement and potential vascular injury. Due to difficulties in maintaining a closed reduction, open reduction and internal fixation is the preferred mode of treatment for the reduction of all posterior clavicular fracture displacements.

The emergency medicine management of clavicle fractures. Clavicle fractures are common. An emergency physician needs to understand the diagnostic classifications of clavicle fractures, have a plan for immobilization, identify associated injuries, understand the difference between treating pediatric and adult patients, and have an approach to multimodal pain control. It is also important to understand when expert orthopedic consultation or referral is indicated. To provide an evidence-based review of clavicle fracture management in the emergency department. Clavicle fractures account for up to 4% of all fractures evaluated in the emergency department. They can be separated into midshaft, distal, and proximal fractures. They are also classified in terms of their degree of displacement, comminution and shortening. Emergent referral is indicated for open fractures, posteriorly displaced proximal fractures, and those with emergent associated injuries. Urgent referral is warranted for fractures with greater than 100% displacement, fractures with &gt;2 cm of shortening, comminuted fractures, unstable distal fractures, and floating shoulder. Nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures with no instability or associated neurovascular injury are managed non-operatively with a sling. Pediatric fractures are generally managed conservatively, with adolescents older than 9 years-old for girls and 12 years-old for boys being treated using algorithms that are similar to adults. When encountering a patient with a clavicle fracture in the emergency department the fracture pattern will help determine whether emergent consultation or urgent referral is indicated. Most patients can be discharged safely with sling immobilization and appropriate outpatient follow-up.

Yield of yearly routine physical examination in HIV-1 infected patients is limited: A retrospective cohort study in the Netherlands. Routine physical examinations might be of value in HIV-infected patients, but the yield is unknown. We determined the diagnoses that would have been missed without performing annual routine physical examinations in HIV-infected patients with stable disease. Data were collected from the medical records of 299 HIV-1-infected patients with CD4 count &gt;350 cells/mm3 if not using combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), or CD4 count &gt;100 cells/mm3 and undetectable viral load if using cART. We defined the diagnoses that would have been missed without performing routine physical examinations on annual check-ups in 2010. Exclusion criteria were hepatitis B/C co-infection, start/ switch of cART &lt; 24 weeks, pregnancy, and transgenderism. 215 patients (72%) had positive findings: lipodystrophy (30%), lymphadenopathy (16%) and hypertension (8.4%) were the most common. Two-thirds of all findings were not new or were based on complaints indicating a physical examination even if not routinely scheduled. For 24 patients (8.0%) the routine physical examination led to the finding of a new diagnosis: six-all men who have sex with men (MSM)-had a concurrent sexually transmitted infection, eight had hypertension, and ten others had a large variety of diagnoses. A total atrioventricular block with bradycardia was the most clinically relevant finding. Annual physical examinations of HIV-infected patients with stable disease brought few new diagnoses that would have been missed without performing a routine examination. Our results suggest that standard assessments could be restricted to six-monthly measuring blood pressure in all patients and annually performing anogenital and digital rectal examination on MSM.

[Efficacy of vaccination against hepatitis B in adult with HIV infection]. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination against hepatitis B in HIV infected individuals and the influence of the stage of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Response for additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine among the patients who do not develop protective anti-HBs level after routine vaccination schedule was analysed. Fifty-four HIV infected individuals, 20 women (37%) and 34 men (63%), 20 to 64 years old (mean age 32 years) were analysed. 32 patients (59.6%), 22 men and 10 women were treated with antiretroviral drugs. Stage of HIV infection was assessed on the basis of data derived from medical records (lowest CD4 cells count, highest viral load), and immunological status at the moment of introduction of vaccination (CD4 cells count, viral load). Efficacy of vaccination was compared with control group, which consisted of 56 healthy volunteers. In both groups hepatitis B virus infection was excluded by serologic tests. HBvaxPro vaccine produced by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Company, dose registered for adults (10 ug) was injected at month 0-1-6. Patients with anti-HBs &lt;10 IU/l have received booster doses of vaccine month intervals, no more then three. Protective level of antibodies was found in 52 (92.9%) persons from control group and 32 (63%) HIV infected individuals. Anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/l was twice more common in control group (80%) than in investigated group (46.3%) (p &lt; 0.001). Protective level of anti-HBs had 14.3% patients with CD4 below 200 cells/pl, none of them had anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/l. Patients with higher CD4 cell count had better response for vaccination (p = 0.015). Differences between patients with high and low viral load were not statistically significant (p = 0.015). Patients with viral load below 10,000 copies/ml had slightly better response then those with higher viral load. Efficacy of vaccination was also associated with the level of distraction of immunological system before introduction of HAART. Patients with CD4 &lt; 200 cells/microl or HIV-RNA &gt; 50,000 copies/ml had worst immunological response for vaccination. After the fist additional dose of vaccine anti-HBs &gt;10 IU/l had 79.7% patients, 87.1% after the second dose and 90.7% after the third dose. Anti-HBs &gt;100 IU/l had subsequently 57.4%, 66.7%, 79.6% patients. We concluded that efficacy of the routine vaccination schedule was lower among HIV individuals in comparison with healthy volunteers. Influence of the progression of HIV infection on the response for vaccination was detected. Additional vaccine's doses have improved efficacy of immunisation which was comparable with general population.

Preventive care among HIV-positive patients in a general medicine practice. We randomly selected a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients from a large university-based general medicine practice to determine how often recommended disease prevention services are received. We used a standardized medical record review protocol to gather data from the records of 159 randomly selected HIV-positive adults followed in a university general medicine practice. We set 80% as the minimum acceptable rate of receipt of each recommended preventive service. Within three months of initiating HIV care, 88% of patients had CD4+ cell counts. Within six months, 75% had serology for syphilis, 64% had purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests, 64% had hepatitis B serology, and 49% had pneumococcal vaccinations. Within one year, 33% had influenza vaccinations. Of 50 subjects eligible for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis (CD4+ cells &lt; 200/mm3), 88% had started prophylaxis within six months. Of 56 subjects eligible for antiretroviral therapy (CD4+ cells &lt; 500/mm3), 77% had started an antiretroviral within six months. Within one year, 22% of 23 subjects with documented nonimmunity to hepatitis B began hepatitis vaccination; only one subject completed the series of three vaccinations. Many HIV-positive patients did not receive appropriate screening tests for tuberculosis and syphilis or vaccinations for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis B. Patients did receive CD4+ cell counts, Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis, and antiretroviral therapy at acceptable rates.

Vaccination in Brazilian HIV-infected adults: a cross-sectional study. HIV-infected patients are at risk for vaccine-preventable infections. The Brazilian National Immunization Program provided recommendations for this population. However, the vaccine coverage reached by this program is unknown. This study aimed at evaluating the vaccine coverage of HIV-infected adults followed at Hospital das ClÃ­nicas, University of SÃ£o Paulo School of Medicine. Data were collected on age, gender, mode of HIV transmission, Centers for Disease Classification 1993 classification (CDC/93), antiretrovirals, CD4 count, HIV viral load, and immunization charts, from April 2003 to August 2004. We interviewed 144 randomly selected patients, 74% male; mean age, 39.95 years; CDC classification: A, 40.6%; B, 19.6%; and C, 39.9%. Most of patients were undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; 86.8%). Mean CD4 count 442.6 cells/mm3. Viral load less than 400 copies per milliliter in 59.4% of patients. Only 36.1% of patients were adequately immunized for diphtheria/tetanus, 54.9% for pneumococcus, 24.3% for flu, and 76.9% for hepatitis B. In relation to live attenuated vaccines, 5 patients received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and 7 patients yellow fever vaccine. Two patients were vaccinated against yellow fever despite CD4 less than 200 cell/mm3. We verified poor vaccine coverage in HIV-infected patients. Vaccination campaigns and incorporation of vaccine rooms in sexually transmitted disease (STD)/AIDS clinics could improve this situation.

[Focal mycobacterial lymphadenitis after starting highly active antiretroviral therapy]. A 30-year-old man with a known HIV infection for 7 years presented for treatment with antiretroviral drugs. He was known to have had herpes zoster, oral hairy leukoplakia and recurrent Candida stomatitis, but was otherwise without symptoms. The CD4 lymphocyte count was 19 cells/mm3 and there were 41,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml. The HIV infection was in CDC stage B3, indicating the need for combined antiretroviral treatment. A week after starting stavudine, saquinavir and ritonavir he had to be admitted because of nausea and vomiting, colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever up to 39 degrees C and a rise of C-reactive protein to 207 mg/dl. Bacteriological examination of feces and biopsy of an enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node revealed atypical mycobacteria. Antituberculosis treatment was started. The CD4 cell count rose to 56/mm3 and the viral count fell to 11,000/ml. Each time after initiating a different antiviral regimen the symptoms recurred. This case illustrates an atypical manifestation of on opportunistic infection: during combined antiviral treatment the CD4 cell count rose and thus precipitated an heretofore subclinical mycobacterial infection with focal lymphadenitis. If, on starting antiretroviral treatment at a late HIV stage, new symptoms develop within 1-3 weeks, one should consider drug-induced side effects or the onset of an opportunistic infection that has become manifest as the result of an improved immunological state.

Yield of yearly routine physical examination in HIV-1 infected patients is limited: A retrospective cohort study in the Netherlands. Routine physical examinations might be of value in HIV-infected patients, but the yield is unknown. We determined the diagnoses that would have been missed without performing annual routine physical examinations in HIV-infected patients with stable disease. Data were collected from the medical records of 299 HIV-1-infected patients with CD4 count &gt;350 cells/mm3 if not using combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), or CD4 count &gt;100 cells/mm3 and undetectable viral load if using cART. We defined the diagnoses that would have been missed without performing routine physical examinations on annual check-ups in 2010. Exclusion criteria were hepatitis B/C co-infection, start/ switch of cART &lt; 24 weeks, pregnancy, and transgenderism. 215 patients (72%) had positive findings: lipodystrophy (30%), lymphadenopathy (16%) and hypertension (8.4%) were the most common. Two-thirds of all findings were not new or were based on complaints indicating a physical examination even if not routinely scheduled. For 24 patients (8.0%) the routine physical examination led to the finding of a new diagnosis: six-all men who have sex with men (MSM)-had a concurrent sexually transmitted infection, eight had hypertension, and ten others had a large variety of diagnoses. A total atrioventricular block with bradycardia was the most clinically relevant finding. Annual physical examinations of HIV-infected patients with stable disease brought few new diagnoses that would have been missed without performing a routine examination. Our results suggest that standard assessments could be restricted to six-monthly measuring blood pressure in all patients and annually performing anogenital and digital rectal examination on MSM.


[Efficacy of vaccination against hepatitis B in adult with HIV infection]. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination against hepatitis B in HIV infected individuals and the influence of the stage of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Response for additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine among the patients who do not develop protective anti-HBs level after routine vaccination schedule was analysed. Fifty-four HIV infected individuals, 20 women (37%) and 34 men (63%), 20 to 64 years old (mean age 32 years) were analysed. 32 patients (59.6%), 22 men and 10 women were treated with antiretroviral drugs. Stage of HIV infection was assessed on the basis of data derived from medical records (lowest CD4 cells count, highest viral load), and immunological status at the moment of introduction of vaccination (CD4 cells count, viral load). Efficacy of vaccination was compared with control group, which consisted of 56 healthy volunteers. In both groups hepatitis B virus infection was excluded by serologic tests. HBvaxPro vaccine produced by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Company, dose registered for adults (10 ug) was injected at month 0-1-6. Patients with anti-HBs &lt;10 IU/l have received booster doses of vaccine month intervals, no more then three. Protective level of antibodies was found in 52 (92.9%) persons from control group and 32 (63%) HIV infected individuals. Anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/l was twice more common in control group (80%) than in investigated group (46.3%) (p &lt; 0.001). Protective level of anti-HBs had 14.3% patients with CD4 below 200 cells/pl, none of them had anti-HBs &gt; 100 IU/l. Patients with higher CD4 cell count had better response for vaccination (p = 0.015). Differences between patients with high and low viral load were not statistically significant (p = 0.015). Patients with viral load below 10,000 copies/ml had slightly better response then those with higher viral load. Efficacy of vaccination was also associated with the level of distraction of immunological system before introduction of HAART. Patients with CD4 &lt; 200 cells/microl or HIV-RNA &gt; 50,000 copies/ml had worst immunological response for vaccination. After the fist additional dose of vaccine anti-HBs &gt;10 IU/l had 79.7% patients, 87.1% after the second dose and 90.7% after the third dose. Anti-HBs &gt;100 IU/l had subsequently 57.4%, 66.7%, 79.6% patients. We concluded that efficacy of the routine vaccination schedule was lower among HIV individuals in comparison with healthy volunteers. Influence of the progression of HIV infection on the response for vaccination was detected. Additional vaccine's doses have improved efficacy of immunisation which was comparable with general population.

Preventive care among HIV-positive patients in a general medicine practice. We randomly selected a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients from a large university-based general medicine practice to determine how often recommended disease prevention services are received. We used a standardized medical record review protocol to gather data from the records of 159 randomly selected HIV-positive adults followed in a university general medicine practice. We set 80% as the minimum acceptable rate of receipt of each recommended preventive service. Within three months of initiating HIV care, 88% of patients had CD4+ cell counts. Within six months, 75% had serology for syphilis, 64% had purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests, 64% had hepatitis B serology, and 49% had pneumococcal vaccinations. Within one year, 33% had influenza vaccinations. Of 50 subjects eligible for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis (CD4+ cells &lt; 200/mm3), 88% had started prophylaxis within six months. Of 56 subjects eligible for antiretroviral therapy (CD4+ cells &lt; 500/mm3), 77% had started an antiretroviral within six months. Within one year, 22% of 23 subjects with documented nonimmunity to hepatitis B began hepatitis vaccination; only one subject completed the series of three vaccinations. Many HIV-positive patients did not receive appropriate screening tests for tuberculosis and syphilis or vaccinations for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, and hepatitis B. Patients did receive CD4+ cell counts, Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis, and antiretroviral therapy at acceptable rates.

Man with a Swollen Eye: Nonspecific Orbital Inflammation in an Adult in the Emergency Department. Nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) is a rare idiopathic ocular pathology characterized by unilateral, painful orbital swelling without identifiable infectious or systemic disorders, which can be complicated by optic nerve compromise. A 50-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with recurring, progressive painless left eye swelling, decreased visual acuity, and binocular diplopia in the absence of trauma, infection, or known malignancy. His physical examination was notable for left-sided decreased visual acuity, an afferent pupillary defect, severe left eye proptosis and chemosis, and restricted extraocular movements; his dilatated funduscopic examination was notable for ipsilateral retinal folds within the macula, concerning for a disruption between the sclera and the retina. Ocular examination of the right eye was unremarkable. Laboratory data were unrevealing. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed marked thickening of the left extraocular muscles associated with proptosis, dense inflammatory infiltration of the orbital fat, and characteristics consistent with perineuritis. The patient was diagnosed with NSOI with optic neuritis and admitted for systemic steroid therapy; he was discharged on hospital day 2 after receiving high-dose intravenous (i.v.) methylprednisolone with significant improvement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: NSOI is a rare and idiopathic ocular emergency, with clinical mimicry resembling a broad spectrum of systemic diseases such as malignancy, autoimmune diseases, endocrine disorders, and infection. Initial work-up for new-onset ocular proptosis should include comprehensive laboratory testing and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Timely evaluation by an ophthalmologist is crucial to assess for optic nerve involvement. Signs of optic nerve compromise include decreased visual acuity, afferent pupillary defect, or decreased color saturation. Patients with optic nerve compromise require admission for aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy with i.v. steroids in an attempt to reduce risk of long-term visual sequelae. Our case demonstrates a severe presentation of this disorder and exhibits remarkable visual recovery after 48Â h of systemic i.v. steroid treatment.

Lung cancer, proptosis, and decreased vision. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of decreased vision in a painful proptotic right eye. The patient was being treated with chemotherapy and radiation for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Examination showed visual acuity of hand motions, decreased motility, and an afferent pupillary defect on the right, consistent with an orbital apex syndrome. Neuroimaging revealed "dirty" orbital fat and no paranasal sinus disease. Orbital biopsy initially showed only fibrosis; however, on subsequent biopsies, nonseptate hyphae later identified as mucormycosis was recovered. The patient survived with exenteration and systemic amphotericin B.

Context:
Traumatic Globe Subluxation Accompanied by Traumatic Optic Neuropathy. A 52-year-old, alcohol-intoxicated woman suffered periorbital trauma to the left eye and presented to the emergency department with proptosis and complaints of decreased vision in the left eye. Physical examination revealed loss of light perception (LP), relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), pupil dilatation, and corneal epithelial defect of the left eye. In addition, the fundus of the left eye was not easily visible due to severe corneal abrasion and edema, but there was no retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage on B-scan ultrasonography. Hertel exophthalmometric values differed by 7âmm between the eyes and measured 13âmm in the right eye and 20âmm in the left eye. In addition, she had severely limited left eye movement in all directions. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging of the orbit showed that the left optic nerve extended 15âmm further than the optic nerve of the right eye and retrobulbar hemorrhage of the left eye. The patient underwent emergency lateral canthotomy, cantholysis, and conjunctival incision to release the optic nerve extension and reduce the eyeball subluxation of the left eye. An intraoperative examination demonstrated that all extraocular muscles of the left eye were intact. The left eyeball returned to its normal position after surgery. Two days after surgery, proptosis of the left eye improved significantly, and there was no difference in Hertel exophthalmometric values between the eyes, both eyes measured 13âmm. However, the patient continued to suffer LP, RAPD, and pupil dilatation of the left eye.




Question:
A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department for severe eye pain. The patient reports that he is a construction worker and was drilling metal beams when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right eye. Since then, the vision in his right eye has seemed blurry and his eye “has not stopped tearing.” The patient’s medical history is significant for type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. His medications include metformin, captopril, and lovastatin. He has a mother with glaucoma, and both his brother and father have coronary artery disease. Upon physical examination, there is conjunctival injection present in the right eye with no obvious lacerations to the eyelids or defects in extraocular eye movements.

Context:
Spontaneous filtering bleb with subsequent secondary glaucoma June consultation #1. A 32-year-old previously healthy woman was referred for evaluation and management of newly diagnosed hypotony in the right eye. Her ocular history was significant only for moderate myopia and an idiopathic Horner syndrome in the left eye diagnosed at age 13. The patient endorsed a history of fluctuating and decreasing vision in the right eye over the past 6 months. She denied any ocular pain, previous ocular surgery, or recent trauma. The patient was otherwise healthy and denied any previous autoimmune disease or systemic infection. She wore soft, daily disposable contact lenses and reported no abnormalities on previous routine eye examinations. At presentation, the patient's uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left. Lensometry revealed a previous refraction of -3.00 + 0.50Ã 150 in the right eye and -4.00 + 1.75Ã 174 in the left. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 4 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg by applanation, and central corneal thicknesses were 573 Î¼m and 564 Î¼m in the right and left eyes, respectively. Slitlamp examination revealed an area of scleral thinning near the limbus in the right eye from 5 to 7 o'clock with mild overlying chemosis (Figure 1JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure1/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff). Gonioscopy showed an open angle with mild trabecular meshwork pigmentation in both eyes without any cyclodialysis clefts, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), or other abnormalities. Dilated fundus examination was significant for mild optic nerve edema and chorioretinal folds in the right eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve confirmed mild disc edema (Figure 2JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure2/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff) and OCT of the macula confirmed mild chorioretinal folds. Anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) and ultrasound biomicroscopy failed to show any other abnormalities. The patient was initially observed without treatment and presented urgently approximately 1 month later with decreased vision and ocular discomfort. Repeat examination revealed an IOP of 31 mm Hg and a focal area of PAS to the previous area of scleral thinning (Figure 3JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure3/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff). In one respect, the newly elevated IOP was considered transiently therapeutic to help reverse the hyperopic shift, disc edema, and hypotony-related maculopathy. However, the situation quickly became more worrisome when shortly thereafter the IOP elevated to 55 mm Hg at subsequent follow-up, and multiple IOP-lowering medications were initiated. Over numerous additional visits, the patient's IOPs ranged from 30 to 39 mm Hg in the right eye despite rapidly advancing to maximally tolerated medical therapy including acetazolamide. She was noted to have a new relative afferent pupillary defect of the right eye, and Humphrey visual fields showed early arcuate defects (Figure 4JOURNAL/jcrs/04.03/02158034-202107000-00023/figure4/v/2021-06-26T110826Z/r/image-tiff). What would be your approach to managing this healthy, young, myopic woman who presented with hypotony due to a spontaneous, perilimbal filtration bleb that later occluded with PAS, resulting in intractably elevated IOP and field loss? What is the differential diagnosis? Would you perform a systemic workup for her initial scleral thinning, and if so, what would you check? Would you intervene for her elevated IOP in the right eye? If so, what would be your surgical approach?

Man with a Swollen Eye: Nonspecific Orbital Inflammation in an Adult in the Emergency Department. Nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) is a rare idiopathic ocular pathology characterized by unilateral, painful orbital swelling without identifiable infectious or systemic disorders, which can be complicated by optic nerve compromise. A 50-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with recurring, progressive painless left eye swelling, decreased visual acuity, and binocular diplopia in the absence of trauma, infection, or known malignancy. His physical examination was notable for left-sided decreased visual acuity, an afferent pupillary defect, severe left eye proptosis and chemosis, and restricted extraocular movements; his dilatated funduscopic examination was notable for ipsilateral retinal folds within the macula, concerning for a disruption between the sclera and the retina. Ocular examination of the right eye was unremarkable. Laboratory data were unrevealing. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed marked thickening of the left extraocular muscles associated with proptosis, dense inflammatory infiltration of the orbital fat, and characteristics consistent with perineuritis. The patient was diagnosed with NSOI with optic neuritis and admitted for systemic steroid therapy; he was discharged on hospital day 2 after receiving high-dose intravenous (i.v.) methylprednisolone with significant improvement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: NSOI is a rare and idiopathic ocular emergency, with clinical mimicry resembling a broad spectrum of systemic diseases such as malignancy, autoimmune diseases, endocrine disorders, and infection. Initial work-up for new-onset ocular proptosis should include comprehensive laboratory testing and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Timely evaluation by an ophthalmologist is crucial to assess for optic nerve involvement. Signs of optic nerve compromise include decreased visual acuity, afferent pupillary defect, or decreased color saturation. Patients with optic nerve compromise require admission for aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy with i.v. steroids in an attempt to reduce risk of long-term visual sequelae. Our case demonstrates a severe presentation of this disorder and exhibits remarkable visual recovery after 48Â h of systemic i.v. steroid treatment.


Lung cancer, proptosis, and decreased vision. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of decreased vision in a painful proptotic right eye. The patient was being treated with chemotherapy and radiation for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Examination showed visual acuity of hand motions, decreased motility, and an afferent pupillary defect on the right, consistent with an orbital apex syndrome. Neuroimaging revealed "dirty" orbital fat and no paranasal sinus disease. Orbital biopsy initially showed only fibrosis; however, on subsequent biopsies, nonseptate hyphae later identified as mucormycosis was recovered. The patient survived with exenteration and systemic amphotericin B.

Pleural effusion is a common encounter in renal failure patients and frequently possess a diagnostic challenge to clinician especially when it was exudative. Fortunately, transudative pleural effusion secondary to fluid overload remains the commonest cause of pleural effusion in haemodialysis patients. Frequent thoracocentesis enhance pleural inflammation and potentially complicate further this challenging clinical presentation. We report a middle-aged gentleman with advanced chronic kidney disease presented with dyspnea and new right upper lobe consolidation on chest roentograph. He had a history of recurrent bilateral pleural effusion secondary to fluid overload and hence multiple attempts of thoracocentesis were performed. Medical thoracoscopy performed previously yielded non-specific pleuritis. Flexible bronchoscopy demonstrates normal airway with negative microbiological studies. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shown a loculated hypodense pleural effusion at the apical region of the right upper lobe. Ultrasound guided thoracocentesis anteriorly yield 400 mL of clear straw color fluid which was transudative by Light's criteria. Post tapping chest X-ray shown complete resolution of right upper lobe consolidation and patient reports immediate relieve of dyspnea. Patient was started on regular effective haemodialysis and pleural effusion did not recur during follow up. Loculated pleural effusion masquerading as mediastinal tumour had been reported but pleural effusion that conformed to the contour of a lung lobe is rare. This case highlights the atypical but unique presentation of a transudative pleural effusion and demonstrates the risk of repeated thoracocentesis complicating a simple clinical presentation.




Question:
A 49-year-old man comes to the hospital for a 10-day history of cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has sharp right-sided chest pain that worsens on inspiration and coughing. Two weeks ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital after passing out on the street from alcohol intoxication but he left against medical advice. He has coronary artery disease and hypertension, and he does not take any medications. He drinks 4 cans of beer daily and has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3° F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg. Examination shows poor dentition. There is dullness to percussion at the base of the right lung. Crackles and markedly decreased breath sounds are heard over the right middle and lower lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows a right-sided loculated pleural effusion and consolidation of the surrounding lung with visible air bronchogram; there are no rib fractures. Thoracocentesis is performed. Examination of this patient's pleural fluid is most likely to show which of the following findings?

[A] : Amylase of 200 U/L

Pleural effusion in temporal arteritis. A 73-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with a one-month history of temporal headache, low-grade fever, fatigue, nocturnal sweats and pleural pain. On the fifth day after admission she developed chest pain at the left site of the thorax, productive cough and progressive dyspnea. A pleural effusion was revealed on physical examination, as well as a bilateral temporal artery thickening. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 135 mm in the 1st hour was found. Chest X-ray showed left pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis revealed serous fluid exudate. A percutaneous pleural biopsy showed only minimal inflammatory changes. Temporal artery biopsy showed giant cell arteritis. The patient received prednisone 60 mg/daily with a dramatic clinical response. Pleural effusion is a rare manifestation of temporal arteritis; only seven cases have been reported worldwide. We present a new case of temporal arteritis with pleurisy.

History, Physical Examination, and Laboratory Findings Associated with Infection and the Empiric Treatment of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia of Women in the Emergency Department. Background Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treated in the emergency department (ED). Objectives To assess the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings associated with NG and CT infection and the decision to administer empiric antibiotic treatment for the diseases in the ED. Methods A retrospective review of 566 clinical encounters of adult female patients tested for STIs between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014. An analysis of patient- and provider-level variables wasÂ assessed to determine the characteristics associated with empiric antibiotic treatment in the ED and post-discharge laboratory confirmed NG or CT. Results Younger age and the presence of TV on vaginal wet prep had a higher association with being infected with NG or CT (p &lt; 0.05). Subjective exam findings, such as vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, dysuria, objective vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, vaginal bleeding, as well as positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites on urinalysis were all not associated with NG or CT infection (p &gt; 0.05). ED providers were more likely to treat subjects in the ED for NG and CT when there was subjective and objective vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, and vaginal bleeding, TV on wet prep, and leukocyte esterase on urinalysis (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Only younger age women and the presence of TV on vaginal wet prep were associated with NG or CT infection. ED providers empirically over-treated with antibiotics ~20 patients uninfected with NG and CT by laboratory confirmation, for every one patient with a laboratory confirmed infection.

A 33-year-old white female with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. A thirty-three year old female presented to our emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On physical examination she was hypotensive with a firm, tender abdomen, cervical motion tenderness and a diffuse erythematous rash. A surgical diagnosis of Acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease was made during laparoscopy. Coagulant studies, liver function tests, culture results, and the desquamation of the patient's palms led to the additional diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome. A literature search failed to reveal any similar cases of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) occurring concomitantly. Patients may present severely ill with either of these disease entities but potential for serious illness is greater when both of these syndromes occur in the same patient. We conclude that in patients with a similar presentation, the symptoms should not be attributed completely to PID without further investigation and consideration of a concomitant disease process including TSS.

A retrospective review of positive chlamydial cultures in emergency department patients. This study evaluated the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of chlamydial infection based solely on clinical presentation in the emergency department (ED). The signs and symptoms of women with chlamydial infection confirmed by cervical culture were identified and compared between appropriately treated and nontreated groups to determine which clinical features tended to lead to the correct or incorrect diagnosis. The study also determined which signs and symptoms were consistently present in the entire study group. Two hundred thirty-three charts of female ED patients with positive cervical chlamydial cultures were obtained via computerized records from the microbiology lab and reviewed retrospectively. Only 20% of the patients were correctly diagnosed as having a sexually transmitted disease and only 24% were properly treated during their initial ED visit. Although abdominal pain and vaginal discharge were the most frequent symptom and sign, only 70% and 54% of all patients had these clinical manifestations, respectively. Patients with vaginal discharge and cervical motion tenderness were significantly (P &lt; .01) more likely to be treated in the ED. Patients with urinary tract symptoms and pregnancy were significantly (P &lt; .01) less likely to be treated in the ED. Cervical cultures should be performed during all pelvic examinations because of the variability in the clinical presentation of chlamydial infection. A follow-up system must be in place to identify positive cultures and locate patients to ensure appropriate treatment.

Delayed Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage as a Complication of Large-volume Paracentesis. Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) consists of the removal of more than four liters of ascitic fluid. ThisÂ procedureÂ can cause complications suchÂ as hemorrhage, infection, bowel perforation, circulatory failure, or ascitic fluid leakage. The main presentation of paracentesis-induced hemorrhage is abdominal wall hematoma. An 81-year-old male with a past medical history of obesity and diabetes mellitusÂ presented to our hospital with confusion, new onset black tarry stools, and foul-smelling urine. He was found to be oriented only to person and had abdominal distention with positive fluid wave sign and melanotic stools on rectal exam. Laboratory results elucidated pancytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 43 U/L, and elevated D-dimer levels.Â Urinalysis was abnormal, showing &gt;180 white blood cells (WBC) with positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Liver ultrasound evidenced cirrhosis. Octreotide drip, ceftriaxone, lactulose,Â and pantoprazole were initiated for upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage and cirrhosis. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of theÂ chest was positive for bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism, therefore, he also started receiving heparin drip. On the fifth day of admission, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis was done, with sixÂ liters of ascitic fluid removed. On the seventh day of admission, the patient presented acute left flank pain with an associated episode of hypotension and drop in hemoglobin. A CTA of the abdomen showed left retroperitoneal hemorrhage but no signs of active bleeding. Heparin drip was discontinued, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).Â The patient's hemoglobin was stable throughout the days after ICU admission, and he did not require any more transfusions of packed red blood cells. His respiratory status was steady although heparin was discontinued due to a bleeding episode.Â He was discharged without anticoagulation therapy due to his high risk for rebleeding. One of the proposed mechanisms leading to variceal bleeding is the rapid decompression of splanchnic circulation due to decreased abdominal pressure. Since the source of bleeding is venous, initially, the patients can be asymptomatic. Treatment can be conservative, surgical or by means of transcatheter interventions. We would like to emphasize the need for the close monitoring of patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, especially in the setting of anticoagulation therapy, as survival depends upon early diagnosis and treatment. It is important to mention that international normalized ratio (INR) is neither a reliable anticoagulation testÂ nor a predictive factor of bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

Subjective exam findings, such as vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, dysuria, objective vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, vaginal bleeding, as well as positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites on urinalysis were all not associated with NG or CT infection (p &gt; 0.05). ED providers were more likely to treat subjects in the ED for NG and CT when there was subjective and objective vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, and vaginal bleeding, TV on wet prep, and leukocyte esterase on urinalysis (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Only younger age women and the presence of TV on vaginal wet prep were associated with NG or CT infection. ED providers empirically over-treated with antibiotics ~20 patients uninfected with NG and CT by laboratory confirmation, for every one patient with a laboratory confirmed infection.


A 33-year-old white female with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. A thirty-three year old female presented to our emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. On physical examination she was hypotensive with a firm, tender abdomen, cervical motion tenderness and a diffuse erythematous rash. A surgical diagnosis of Acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease was made during laparoscopy. Coagulant studies, liver function tests, culture results, and the desquamation of the patient's palms led to the additional diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome. A literature search failed to reveal any similar cases of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) occurring concomitantly. Patients may present severely ill with either of these disease entities but potential for serious illness is greater when both of these syndromes occur in the same patient. We conclude that in patients with a similar presentation, the symptoms should not be attributed completely to PID without further investigation and consideration of a concomitant disease process including TSS.

Cardiac diphtheria in a previously immunized individual. A previously healthy 19-year-old Asian female without significant past medical history presented to the emergency room complaining of a sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, fever, swollen neck, malaise, and myalgia for three to four days. The patient was initially seen at an outside hospital, evaluated by an ear, nose, and throat physician (ENT), and was found to have desquamative pharyngitis. The patient was transferred to our hospital after she continued to experience progressively worsening shortness of breath and went into acute respiratory distress. The patient was found to have laryngeal edema on exam with greenish-black, necrotic-looking tissue extending to the hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and oropharynx. A culture was taken. ENT was consulted for tracheostomy placement. The patient refused to have tracheostomy placed. She went into severe respiratory distress and required urgent tracheostomy. A cardiac consult was obtained. A 2D echocardiogram performed one day after admission revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 10-20%, normal left ventricular cavity size, normal wall thickness, and severe global systolic dysfunction. There was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid regurgitation. The inferior vena cava was dilated and a 1 cm x 1.5 cm questionable mass or thrombus was seen. The patient's throat culture was positive for diphtheria. The CDC was contacted, and the patient was treated with antitoxin with prompt resolution of cardiac symptoms. A repeat echo done five days post-treatment showed improved EF of 65%, normal left ventricular thickness and function, with no clot visualized. She was treated with ceftriaxone and flagyl for ocular motor neuritis, otitis media, and strep. pneumonia with gradual improvement. These were all secondary to the diphtheria toxins, however, the patient continues to be followed as an outpatient by ENT for ongoing problems with swallowing, speech, and trach management.

Infectious disease capsules: a pox on your house. A 31-year-old, previously healthy white man presented to the emergency department with complaints of malaise, fevers, shortness of breath, a non-productive cough, and a "rash." His physical exam revealed a temperature of 100.2F, a pulse of 129 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 BPM, and blood pressure of 140/74 mm Hg. He was alert, oriented, and in no distress. His oropharynx was dry, his neck was supple, and cervical lymphadenopathy was absent. He had tachycardia, bilateral wheezes, and rhonchi with prolonged expirations. There was a diffuse vesicular eruption enveloping his entire body with involvement sparing his palms and soles (Figures 1 and 2). Laboratory values showed a hemoglobin of 16.0 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 7100 cells/pL, with 39%neutrophils, 23% bands, and 35% lymphocytes. His platelet count was mildly decreased to 86,000 x 103/pL. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. A diagnosis of acute varicella-zoster virus pneumonia (varicella pneumonia) was made, and the patient was started on IV acyclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 hours). Upon further questioning, the patient stated that his daughter had been diagnosed with "chickenpox" 7 days ago. The patient had numerous exposures to chickenpox in the past but had never developed clinical expressions of varicella. He was not at risk for HIV infection, not having multiple sexual partners, IV drug abuse, or blood transfusions. During the 1 day of in-hospitalization, his fever abated and the pulmonary signs diminished. Following discharge, IV acyclovir was replaced by valacyclovir to complete a 7-day course of therapy.

Do not forget about HELLP! A 32-year-old female para 4 gravi 3, who was 21 weeks pregnant, presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, headache, blurred vision and vomiting. On arrival, she was agitated and confused with a blood pressure 162/106 mm Hg, pulse rate 107, respiratory rate 18, temperature 37 degrees Celsius, point of care blood glucose 6.2 and her Glasgow coma scale was 13/15 M6V4E3. Paramedics witnessed seizure-like activity lasting &lt;1 min during transport. A diagnosis of eclampsia complicated by the HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets count) was made. She was commenced on magnesium and labetalol intravenously for blood pressure control. Initial blood test results were consistent with the HELLP syndrome. Recognition of the HELLP syndrome with prompt management of blood pressure and clotting abnormalities is essential in the ED setting. An aggressive multidisciplinary approach is a key to optimise the prognosis for mother and fetus.

Lithium intoxication presenting as altered consciousness and arrhythmia with cardiogenic shock: A case report. Lithium has been used to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic index, with a therapeutic level between 0.6 and 1.5âmEq/L. The possible complications of lithium overdose include altered mental status, hand tremor, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizure, syncope, and arrhythmia. Lithium intoxication can be fatal and is difficult to diagnose in patients without a history of lithium intake. The occurrence of serious cardiac arrhythmias is rare in lithium intoxication. An 81-year-old man was brought to the emergency department because of consciousness disturbance for 2 days. According to his daughter, he had a history of hypertension and diabetes. Recently, his family also observed slurring of speech and easy choking. The physical examination findings were unremarkable. Blood examination only revealed impaired renal function. Twelve-lead electrocardiography revealed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block. Chest radiography revealed mediastinal widening. The blood pressures obtained from the 4 limbs showed no significant differences. Subsequently, brain computed tomography revealed no obvious intracranial lesion. A neurologist was consulted, and a recent ischemic stroke could not be ruled out. While in the observation area, his systolic blood pressure decreased to &lt;90âmm Hg and he showed bradycardia, and 12-lead electrocardiography revealed an AV block and long pulse. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed no evidence of aortic dissection. Another family member reported a history of lithium intake for bipolar disorder for &gt;30 years. Blood examination revealed a lithium concentration of 2.65âmEq/L. A nephrologist was consulted, and emergency hemodialysis was indicated. Dopamine was administered for his shock status via a right neck central venous catheter. His lithium level gradually declined after the hemodialysis, and blood pressure and consciousness level improved subsequently. The patient was discharged 9 days later in a stable condition. If an emergency physician encounters a patient with altered consciousness and arrhythmia with cardiogenic shock, the patient's drug intake history should be carefully reviewed to rule out cardiovascular problems on the basis of the patient's clinical condition.

Ascending Paralysis in a 36-Year-Old Woman With Bipolar Disorder and Recent Aspiration Pneumonia. Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy affecting both motor and sensory peripheral nerves. Typically presenting after a gastrointestinal or a respiratory tract infection, it manifests as ascending paralysis with concomitant areflexia in patients. Cytoalbuminologic dissociation is a supportive finding on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Due to variability in presentation, misdiagnosis and delay in treatment can occur, and consequently, GBS can become life threatening due to respiratory failure. We report ascending paralysis in a 36-year-old woman with known history of bipolar disorder who recently recovered from aspiration pneumonia following a drug overdose event. Given her psychiatric history, she was initially misdiagnosed as conversion disorder. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy was initiated at our hospital due to strong suspicion of GBS, based on history and physical examination findings consistent with flaccid quadriparesis and impending respiratory failure. CSF analysis and radiological findings subsequently supported our clinical suspicion and clinical findings. Concurrent IVIG therapy, pain management, aggressive physical and respiratory therapy, and monitoring resulted in symptom improvement. One must have a high index of suspicion for GBS when presented with acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies in patients who present with ascending paralysis. Early initiation of therapy is key and can prevent life-threatening complications.

Human intravenous injection of Î²-cyfluthrin with minimal toxic effects. A 28-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) 20 minutes after injecting 20 mL of an insecticide containing 0.05% Î²-cyfluthrin. Upon presentation, he had no complaints; and vital signs demonstrated a sinus tachycardia of 150 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/65 mm Hg, no fever, and a normal respiratory rate. Further physical examination was notable only for the lack of tremor and the presence of a left antecubital recent injection site. The patient denied use of other drugs that day, but admitted to recent use of methamphetamine. He was taking oxcarbazepine, lurasidone, and venlafaxine for reported bipolar affective disorder and schizophrenia. The ED evaluation included an electrocardiogram demonstrating sinus tachycardia, undetectable acetaminophen and salicylate levels, and a urine drug screen that was positive for methamphetamine and tetrahydrocannabinol. The patient was treated with an intravenous fluid bolus of 2000 mL and observed in the ED. Over the course of the subsequent 3 hours, his pulse rate went down to 90/min. He remained asymptomatic and was transferred to the Psychiatric Assessment Unit after approximately 6 hours of observation. We present the first published case of cyfluthrin parenteral human injection. Although this patient experienced a benign clinical course, vigilance for pyrethroid toxic effects such as seizures, severe tremors, diaphoresis, and choreoathetosis is paramount.

[Gastroenteritis with fever, headache and rash after travelling in India]. A 63-year-old patient presented to our emergency unit two days after returning from India suffering from watery diarrhea, nausea, fever and headache. On admission we found a maculopapular rash on his trunk and forehead. Laboratory findings revealed a leuko-thrombopenia and elevated levels of CRP and procalcitonin. We started treatment with ciprofloxacin. After 48 hours of treatment the diarrhea subsided, whereas the rush on his trunk increased. Under the suspicion of rickettsial fever we started doxycycline 200 mg/d. Because of an incipient pneumonia we added ceftriaxon. The patient improved rapidly and the laboratory abnormalities resolved. Serological investigations revealed a significant increase of specific antibodies against Rickettsia typhi. In conclusion, headache with fever and maculopapular rash after traveling to endemic countries should rise suspicion for murine typhus.

Bloody diarrhea years after resection of a rib. A 32-year-old man presented with bloody diarrhea of new onset. For three days he had had 10 to l5 bowel movements per day containing bright red blood. He also had had one black, tarry stool, but no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or constipation. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed acute gastritis, and colonoscopy was interpreted as unremarkable; he was then transferred to our institution for further workup.

Clinical Case of the Month: A 48-Year-Old Man With Fever and Abdominal Pain of One Day Duration. A 48-year-old man residing in a mental health department inpatient program with a history of schizoaffective disorder presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of fever and intense abdominal pain for one day. The patient stated he initially fell in the shower and afterwards experienced back pain. He was transferred to an acute care unit within the facility for further evaluation. The facility physician noted that the patient had a mild temperature elevation and abdominal rigidity on exam. At that time, he was given two doses of benztropine intramuscularly, and transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. The patient exhibited fever, diffuse abdominal pain and a nonproductive cough, but denied chills, dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, weakness, diarrhea, melena or hematochezia. He did have a one-week history of constipation for which he was given sodium phosphate enemas, magnesium citrate and docusate sodium, eventually resulting in a bowel movement. He also complained of new onset dysphagia. There were no recent changes to his medications, which included clonazepam, divalproex sodium extended release, olanzapine and risperidone. He denied use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.

A 21-Year-Old Immunocompetent Man With Hemoptysis and Rash. A 21-year-old man presented to the ED of The George Washington University Hospital complaining of chills, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and a generalized rash. Three days before admission, he noticed a productive cough, severe sore throat, and subjective fever. He also experienced extreme fatigue, generalized sweating, and chest pain with coughing. On the day before admission, he experienced a nonpruritic rash on his neck, palms, and dorsal surfaces of his feet and sputum with streaks of blood. The patient had no significant medical or family history. He had no sick contacts, and his only recent travel was to an outdoor concert in a woody area of the northeastern United States about a month earlier. He did not report recent contact with birds or visits to caves. He is single, lives alone in an apartment, and consumes about 4 alcoholic beverages a week. Occasionally, he smokes cannabis and e-cigarettes. He is sexually active with men, and his last unprotected sexual encounter was a month earlier. He denied photophobia, rhinorrhea, ear pain, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria.


[Gastroenteritis with fever, headache and rash after travelling in India]. A 63-year-old patient presented to our emergency unit two days after returning from India suffering from watery diarrhea, nausea, fever and headache. On admission we found a maculopapular rash on his trunk and forehead. Laboratory findings revealed a leuko-thrombopenia and elevated levels of CRP and procalcitonin. We started treatment with ciprofloxacin. After 48 hours of treatment the diarrhea subsided, whereas the rush on his trunk increased. Under the suspicion of rickettsial fever we started doxycycline 200 mg/d. Because of an incipient pneumonia we added ceftriaxon. The patient improved rapidly and the laboratory abnormalities resolved. Serological investigations revealed a significant increase of specific antibodies against Rickettsia typhi. In conclusion, headache with fever and maculopapular rash after traveling to endemic countries should rise suspicion for murine typhus.

A 13-year-old female presented at her pediatrician's office with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, right-sided knee pain that had been present for the previous three days without any known trauma and no association with activity. Her medical history was significant for fractures, and on physical exam, there was a hard mass palpated on the medial aspect of her distal thigh that was nontender, nonmobile, and without overlying skin changes. The plain radiograph findings were consistent with a hook-shaped osteochondroma of the right medial distal metaphysis. Orthopedics recommended conservative management with continued ibuprofen for pain and six-week follow-up with repeat radiograph to evaluate for progression. The follow-up radiograph showed no interval growth. However, due to continued pain, the patient had surgical excision of the osteochondroma sixâmonths after initial presentation, allowing her to finish her current soccer season. The surgery was successful, and the patient did well after operation with no residual pain.

Ewing sarcoma superimposed on a previous osteochondroma in multiple osteochondromatosis. It has been reported that patients with hereditary multiple exostoses (called multiple osteochondromatosis by the World Health Organization) are at increased risk for malignant transformation of osteochondromas to secondary chondrosarcomas. A review of the literature found 14 cases showing transformation of osteochondromas into osteosarcomas; however, Ewing sarcoma has never been reported superimposed on an osteochondroma. This article presents the case of a boy who underwent biopsy of a previously existent osteochondroma for which the pathology report showed cytologic and immunohistochemical properties consistent with Ewing sarcoma. A 13-year-old boy with hereditary multiple exostoses (multiple osteochondromatosis) presented to an orthopedic clinic because of waxing and waning pain superficial to a previous osteochondroma on the lateral aspect of the right leg, below the knee, of 1 month's duration. On examination, inflammation was noted over a bony mass associated with tenderness to palpation of the affected area. There was no evidence of penetrating injury or trauma, and the patient reported no constitutional symptoms, including fever. Radiographs showed marked osteolysis and signs of periosteal reaction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of cortical bone erosion and extension of the mass into soft tissue. Malignant transformation was suspected, and the patient underwent biopsy. The pathology findings were consistent with Ewing sarcoma. The highly uncommon presentation of this malignancy must serve as a red flag to other physicians who treat patients with hereditary multiple exostoses. Ewing sarcoma tends to be of higher grade and have a worse prognosis than other malignancies that are more commonly seen in these patients.

The patient's medical diagnosis was Osgood-Schlatter disease, based on radiographs obtained at the initial pediatrician consultation. An MRI scan was obtained 2 weeks after starting physical therapy and revealed a bony lesion near the medial condyle of the right femur and damage to medial joint structures. Pathology after open biopsy and curettage of the lesion revealed a chondroblastoma.

Slipped Distal Femoral Epiphysis in Congenital Insensitivity to Pain. Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) is a rare disorder, and often presents to an orthopaedic surgeon as recurrent fractures, dislocations, pseudoarthrosis, osteomyelitis etc. Here, we report a case of congenital insensitivity to pain presenting with distal femoral physeal separation in a child. A 12-year-old girl child came with complaints of limp while walking and swelling in the left knee for past 5 weeks. Mother gave a history that the girl is a known case of congenital insensitivity to pain with clear history of no pain on intramuscular injection since birth. She was born of consanguineous marriage and had no significant trauma, fever, other joint involvement or any features of rheumatism. On local examination, she had no bony tenderness, mild warmth, and moderate knee effusion with restricted range of movement. Plain radiograph showed epiphysiolysis of distal femur with widening of physis. Examination under anaesthesia demonstrated gross movement indicating lower femoral physeal separation. This unstable distal femoral epiphysis was treated under general anaesthesia with closed reduction, percutaneous cross pinning and above knee plaster cast. Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) is a rare disorder to diagnose. Emphasis is given on early diagnosis of orthopaedic problems and prompt treatment, educating parents and prevention of accidents. Physeal separation without significant trauma must prompt an orthopaedic surgeon to think about congenital insensitivity to pain as a differential diagnosis.

Benign methylmalonic acidemia in a sibship with distal renal tubular acidosis. Two male infants born to consanguineous parents were investigated for feeding difficulties in the 1st month of life. Both were found to have distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) with hypercalciuria. Nephrocalcinosis was present in the first child but not in the second. Urinary organic acid profile demonstrated an excess of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in both children in the absence of any other organic acid. MMA mutase activity and propionate incorporation were normal. There have been no neurological symptoms in either child. The first child has normal growth and psychomotor development at 4 years. His brother, who also has significant gastrooesophageal reflux, has failed to thrive and currently requires nasogastric feeding and caloric supplements to maintain weight along the 3rd percentile. Urinary and plasma MMA continue to be raised in both cases. The association of increased urinary and plasma MMA and dRTA presenting in the 1st month of life has not previously been reported and may represent a new syndrome of autosomal recessive inheritance.

Blood cell count showed a macrocytosis without anemia (case 2-3) and a severe microcytic anemia for the first case caused by a mild alpha-thalassemia, with megaloblastic bone marrow. Vitamin B12 levels were very low associated with increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine serum levels which confirm the diagnostic . Cerebral imaging showed diffuse cortical atrophy. Cobalamin deficiency was caused by strict vegetarian diets mothers of breastfed infants (cases 2-3) and for younger by mother's unrecognized pernicious anemia. 3 mothers had no anemia and normal B12 's levels at diagnosis. Vitamin B12 supply lead to a rapid clinical and hematologic improvement. In two cases, neurologic recovery was incomplete. About one hundred case of B12 deficiency 's infant are reported, 2/3 are breast-fed by vegetarian mothers, and 1/4 have mothers with pernicious anemia. The failure to thrive is due to anorexia, refusal of weaning and partial villous atrophy. Neurologic manifestations are secondary to cerebral disorders, sometimes revealed by an exposure to anesthetic nitrous oxyd. The macrocytic anemia is inconstant. The etiologic research of developmental delay in an infant may include vitamin B12's deficiency, even if there is no haematologic signs, especially if breast-fedding 's mothers is vegetarian.

Methylmalonic acidemia: diagnosis and neuroimaging findings of this neurometabolic disorder (an Iranian pediatric case series). Methylmalonic acidemia is one of the inborn errors of metabolism resulting in the accumulation of acylcarnitine in blood and increased urinary methylmalonic acid excretion. This disorder can have symptoms, such as neurological and gastrointestinal manifestations, lethargy, and anorexia. The patients who were diagnosed as methylmalonic acidemia in the Neurology Department of Mofid Children's Hospital in Tehran, Iran, between 2002 and 2012 were included in our study. The disorder was confirmed by clinical findings, neuroimaging findings, and neurometabolic and genetic assessment in reference laboratory in Germany. We assessed the age, gender, past medical history, developmental status, clinical manifestations, and neuroimaging findings of 20 patients with methylmalonic acidemia. Eighty percent of the patients were offspring of consanguineous marriages. Half of the patients had Failure to thrive (FTT) due to anorexia; 85% had history of developmental delay or regression, and 20% had refractory seizure, which all of them were controlled. The patients with methylmalonic acidemia were followed for approximately 5 years and the follow-up showed that the patients with early diagnosis had a more favorable clinical response in growth index, refractory seizure, anorexia, and neurodevelopmental delay. Neuroimaging findings included brain atrophy, basal ganglia involvement (often in putamen), and periventricular leukomalacia. According to the results of this study, we suggest that early assessment and diagnosis have an important role in the prevention of disease progression and clinical signs.

Methylmalonic Acidemia. Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) is an inborn error of metabolism that results in accumulation of methylmalonic acid in blood and increased excretion in urine. The effects of MMA vary from mild to life threatening and it usually presents in early infancy. Affected infants can have vomiting, dehydration, hypotonia, developmental delay and failure to thrive. The emergency treatment of the newborn with MMA mainly comprises rehydration and promotion of anabolism, followed by long-term dietary management by both the restriction of precursor amino acids using a low protein diet and avoidance of prolonged fasting. Prognosis depends on the type of MMA and whether the condition is well controlled in general and during episodes of metabolic decompensation. We report here the presentation and management of a 2-year boy with MMA who failed to achieve expected milestones for age. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of MMA has been reported from Pakistan.

Methylmalonic acidemia: 6 years' clinical experience with two variants unresponsive to vitamin B12 therapy. Two infants with lethargy, vomiting, convulsions, coma and marked metabolic acidosis were found to have very high concentrations of methylmalonic acid in their serum and urine. In vitro studies of fibroblasts demonstrated that the infants had different variants of methylmalonic acidemia.Vitamin B(12) was given in two different forms at 1 month of age and at 12 months of age. Each trial continued for 4 months but neither infant showed a clinical or biochemical response.In both infants hyperglycinemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed during acute metabolic crises only. Hypoglycemia was found in patient 2. Hyperammonemia was severe in patient 2 during acute crises but never appeared in patient 1. When clinically well, both infants continued to excrete abnormal amounts of methylmalonic acid in the urine and both had persistent compensated metabolic acidosis.Marked hyperuricemia developed in patient 1 at 18 months of age and led to progressive renal failure. Allopurinol therapy was necessary to keep the uric acid concentration within the normal range. Renal function returned to normal, as indicated by a marked increase in the renal clearance of creatinine and uric acid.Patient 1 is physically and mentally retarded, and has moderate hypotonia, hepatomegaly and persistent vomiting. Patient 2 has developed normally.The urine concentrations of methylmalonic acid in the four parents were normal.

Temporomandibular disorder or not? A case report. The purpose of this case study is to show the need for a good differential diagnosis of suspected temporomandibular disorder (TMD) with otologic symptoms. This study is a clinical case referring to a patient seeking treatment for pain in the right maxilla. The usual Medical History for diagnosis of a TMD was applied. Anamnesis revealed the patient had had a right maxillary pain for one month, a slight hearing loss and dizziness for the past five to six months, and two implants placed in the upper jaw two years previously. Clinical examination showed right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) clicking and tenderness in the lateral pterygoid muscles and in the right masseter muscle. Temporomandibular disorder and orofacial pain were diagnosed, and the appropriate treatment was initiated. In addition, a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was requested and revealed acoustic neuroma. The coexistence of TMD with otovestibular symptoms suggests the need for a cranial MRI evaluation, especially if the dental or TMD treatment has not been positive.

Paraneoplastic polyarthritis in an ovarian teratoma. A 34-year-old woman presented to the rheumatology clinic with severe low back pain and arthralgia; later she developed bilateral knee pain and swelling, with limitation in ambulation and minimal improvement with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Two weeks later she developed pain on the volar aspect of the right wrist and on the hypothenar region of the right hand. Examination showed swelling and tenderness of the right hypothenar region, tenderness and decreased flexion and extension of the right wrist, and bilateral knee effusions. The combination of arthritis and tenosynovitis raised the possibility of an ovarian tumor. A pelvic ultrasound revealed a complex, hyperechoic ovarian mass consistent with a cystic teratoma. Four weeks after removal of the teratoma, the polyarthritis and related symptoms resolved without therapy.

Internal laryngocoele and referred otalgia. A 74-year-old woman presented with severe right ear pain associated with bleeding of 2 months' duration and vertigo. She was otherwise fit and well apart from arthritis. On examination there was dried blood overlying the right ear drum and very mild inflammation of the canal but no obvious acute infection. The dried blood was removed in subsequent clinic visits. The ear drum was intact and there was no evidence of infection. However, the patient still had persistent pain in the right ear. A diagnosis of referred otalgia was made. Nose, throat, neck, temporo-mandibular joint, oral examination and flexible nasoendoscopic examination were normal. She underwent MRI of her neck which revealed a right supraglottic mass. Laryngoscopy was performed. Intra-operative findings revealed a smooth right supraglottic mass, which was thought to be an internal laryngocoele. The laryngocoele was de-roofed. The histology specimen showed no evidence of neoplasia.

Early Detection and Aggressive Management of Otologic Pathologies in Children with Down Syndrome. A 13-year-old boy with Down syndrome (DS) presents to the pediatric otolaryngologist after being lost to follow-up for several years. The child is accompanied by his stepmother, who has recently been granted full custody together with his father. The stepmother states that the child's mother was non-compliant with his medical care and now, as she describes it, they are "playing catch-up." According to his stepmother, he has a history of recurrent ear infections and had tympanostomy tubes inserted in the past (date(s) unknown). The child has several other co-morbidities including severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), premature ventricular beats and possible hypothyroidism. He receives services in school for his speech and language delays in addition to regular physical and occupational therapy. The child was referred by his pediatrician who initially sent him for an audiological evaluation after failing a hearing test in the office. The child's audiogram is consistent with bilateral, severe mixed sensorineural (SNHL) and conductive hearing loss (CHL) and reveals small canal volumes consistent with bilateral middle ear effusions (MEE). The physical exam also reveals bilateral MEE and possible cholesteatoma in the right ear, consistent with chronic otitis media. This case highlights the need for early education of families in the primary care setting when the diagnosis of DS is made, in order to ensure that the child receives adequate care to maximize developmental potential and quality of life.

Temporomandibular disorder or not? A case report. The purpose of this case study is to show the need for a good differential diagnosis of suspected temporomandibular disorder (TMD) with otologic symptoms. This study is a clinical case referring to a patient seeking treatment for pain in the right maxilla. The usual Medical History for diagnosis of a TMD was applied. Anamnesis revealed the patient had had a right maxillary pain for one month, a slight hearing loss and dizziness for the past five to six months, and two implants placed in the upper jaw two years previously. Clinical examination showed right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) clicking and tenderness in the lateral pterygoid muscles and in the right masseter muscle. Temporomandibular disorder and orofacial pain were diagnosed, and the appropriate treatment was initiated. In addition, a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation was requested and revealed acoustic neuroma. The coexistence of TMD with otovestibular symptoms suggests the need for a cranial MRI evaluation, especially if the dental or TMD treatment has not been positive.


Paraneoplastic polyarthritis in an ovarian teratoma. A 34-year-old woman presented to the rheumatology clinic with severe low back pain and arthralgia; later she developed bilateral knee pain and swelling, with limitation in ambulation and minimal improvement with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Two weeks later she developed pain on the volar aspect of the right wrist and on the hypothenar region of the right hand. Examination showed swelling and tenderness of the right hypothenar region, tenderness and decreased flexion and extension of the right wrist, and bilateral knee effusions. The combination of arthritis and tenosynovitis raised the possibility of an ovarian tumor. A pelvic ultrasound revealed a complex, hyperechoic ovarian mass consistent with a cystic teratoma. Four weeks after removal of the teratoma, the polyarthritis and related symptoms resolved without therapy.

Diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy disease in gastrointestinal biopsies. A 14-year-old boy with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease had a lifelong history of failure to thrive and gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, pain, and diarrhea, leading to progressive cachexia. At the age of 9 years, after an extensive workup, the diagnosis of Crohn disease was strongly suspected, and he underwent colonoscopy with multiple biopsies. At 11 years of age, vision change and poor balance lead to a diagnosis of leukodystrophy by magnetic resonance imaging. Investigations for metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenal leukodystrophy, and globoid cell leukodystrophy were all negative. A diagnosis of MNGIE disease was suspected when he continued deteriorating with gastrointestinal symptoms, multiple neurologic deficits, and encephalopathy. Markedly diminished thymidine phosphorylase activity and increased thymidine plasma levels confirmed the diagnosis of MNGIE. At autopsy, megamitochondria were observed by light microscopy in submucosal and myenteric ganglion cells and in smooth muscle cells of muscularis mucosae and muscularis propria, along the entire gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. Megamitochondria in ganglion cells were also observed in a retrospective review of the endoscopic intestinal biopsies taken at age 9 and 13 years and in the appendectomy specimen obtained 1 month before his demise. This study corroborates the presence of megamitochondria in gastrointestinal ganglion cells in MNGIE disease, better illustrates their detailed morphology, and describes for the first time similar structures in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. Pathologists should be able to recognize these structures by light microscopy and be aware of their association with primary mitochondriopathies.

An infant with severe refractory Crohn's disease and homozygous MEFV mutation who dramatically responded to colchicine. Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory bowel disease is particulary frequent and severe in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) families. An 8-month-old boy was admitted to our hospital with chronic bloody diarrhea, failure to thrive and high-grade fever. He was diagnosed as Crohn's disease (CD) based on clinical, laboratory and histological findings and, corticosteroid therapy was started. The patient did not respond to intensive medical therapy including intravenous corticosteroid, mesalazine, azathioprine, intravenous cyclosporine and enteral feeding. MEFV gene mutation analysis revealed homozygous M694V mutation. In addition to azathioprine and cyclosporine therapy, with the diagnosis of FMF, colchicine therapy was started and partial remission was observed within 2 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of association of CD and FMF in an infant. In cases of CD resistant to medical therapy, possibility of underlying FMF should be considered, especially in countries where FMF is prevalent.

[Diagnostic difficulties in pediatric abdominal pain with potential appendicitis]. Pediatric abdominal pain is one of the most common symptom of children brought to attention of primary care physicians and pediatric surgeons. In many children clinical symptoms may be uncharacteristic and may lead to diagnostic difficulties. Clinical analysis of children with right lower quadrant abdominal pain suspected of appendicitis or children with periappendicular mass. The histories of 14 children aged from 18 months to 17 years treated in Pediatric Clinic were analysed. All children were operated because of right lower quadrant abdominal pain or abdominal mass before admission to the Pediatric Clinic or during hospitalization in Pediatric Clinic. Intraoperatively in all children pathologies other than appendicitis were the cause of symptoms. The most often Crohn's disease were recognized (9 children), in 2 cases with concomitant other pathologies (fecal tumor of appendix in one case and with peritoneal abscess after perforation of intestinal wall). Sporadically the inflammation of the mesenterial lymph nodes caused by Yersinia infection suggested appendicitis. In one boy with ulcerative colitis, during exacerbation of the disease appendicitis complicated by rupture and peritonitis was observed. In 18-month old child with right lower quadrant abdominal mass invagination complicated by perforation of the ileum was recognized. In the case of 14-years old boy 6 months after appendectomy we observed mechanical intestinal obstruction complicated by perforation and peritonitis. Carcinoid of the appendix was the cause of abdominal pain in one child. 1. Appendicitis is the most frequent surgical etiology of the right lower quadrant pediatric abdominal pain. 2. Despite new diagnostic imagines there are no definite criteria to recognize appendicitis, in most cases physical examination and very carefull evaluation of abdominal pain are the most important. 3. All children with periappendipected of Crohn's disease. 4. All children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis and with normal appendix during operation should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

[Diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease in children: 10 years' clinical experience]. To enhance our understanding of pediatric Crohn's disease and improve diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy by characterizing the clinical picture and reviewing 10 years' clinical experience in diagnosis and treatment. Nine cases with active Crohn's disease diagnosed between 1996 and 2005, including 8 males and 1 female, aged 6 - 13 years, were reviewed. Clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and histological data as well as therapeutic results were analized. The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis was 10 months. The sites of involvement were both the small intestine and colon in 6, small intestine only in 3. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were the two most common gastrointestinal symptoms. The main extraintestinal manifestations were weight loss in 7, hypoalbuminemia in 5, mild anemia in 5, fever in 4 and hypocalcemia in 2. All the patients had undergone colonoscopy, and the findings included ulcerations, segmental lesions, cobblestone appearance, pseudopolyps and perianal abnormalities. Capsule endoscopic examination in one patient demonstrated the segmental distribution with typical longitudinal cleft-like ulcers and cobblestone appearance. Gastrointestinal barium meal X-ray examination was performed in 7 patients, the main findings were segmental strictures and abnormal mucosa. Histological examination of biopsy specimens mainly showed nonspecific chronic inflammation. Non-caseating granulomas were identifiable in 2 cases. Although there were many macroscopic and microscopic features supporting the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, no epithelioid granuloma could be found in surgical specimens of two patients. Treatment was given up by parents of 2 patients after the diagnosis was established. All the other 7 patients were treated with 5-acetylsalicylic acid, antibiotics and nutritional support during the acute phase. Corticosteroids were used in two patients. Long-term remission was achieved and maintained in 3 children, and in one of them medication could be discontinued and had no signs of disease activity at the end of the follow-up. Children and adolescents presenting with Crohn's disease commonly have weight loss and nutritional impairment, which may provide clues to the diagnosis. Appropriate formulation and higher dosage of 5-acetylsalicylic acid [30-50 mg/(kg x d)] may be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in pediatric Crohn's disease.

[Clinical characteristics of Crohn's disease in children and adults]. There are few reports contrasting the clinical characteristics of Crohn's disease in different age groups. We therefore compared retrospectively children and adults with Crohn's disease. 23 children (mean age: 12.8 +/- 2.5 years) and 66 adults (mean age: 27.0 +/- 4.0 years) were studied. Presenting symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea were significantly more common in adults, while in children anorexia and weight loss were more frequent. Children tended to present with extra-gastrointestinal tract symptoms as well, mainly anemia and joint involvement. Common symptoms during active disease did not differ between groups, except that weight loss, evident in all children, was found in only 70% of adults. Anemia was present during active disease in all pediatric cases but in only 62% of adults. There were no significant differences between groups regarding disease location, gastrointestinal complications and extra-intestinal manifestations. We conclude that in children Crohn's disease may differ significantly, mainly presenting with nonclassical symptoms, such as anemia and joint involvement. The primary care physician should be aware of these differences.

At autopsy, megamitochondria were observed by light microscopy in submucosal and myenteric ganglion cells and in smooth muscle cells of muscularis mucosae and muscularis propria, along the entire gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. Megamitochondria in ganglion cells were also observed in a retrospective review of the endoscopic intestinal biopsies taken at age 9 and 13 years and in the appendectomy specimen obtained 1 month before his demise. This study corroborates the presence of megamitochondria in gastrointestinal ganglion cells in MNGIE disease, better illustrates their detailed morphology, and describes for the first time similar structures in the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. Pathologists should be able to recognize these structures by light microscopy and be aware of their association with primary mitochondriopathies.


An infant with severe refractory Crohn's disease and homozygous MEFV mutation who dramatically responded to colchicine. Previous studies have suggested that inflammatory bowel disease is particulary frequent and severe in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) families. An 8-month-old boy was admitted to our hospital with chronic bloody diarrhea, failure to thrive and high-grade fever. He was diagnosed as Crohn's disease (CD) based on clinical, laboratory and histological findings and, corticosteroid therapy was started. The patient did not respond to intensive medical therapy including intravenous corticosteroid, mesalazine, azathioprine, intravenous cyclosporine and enteral feeding. MEFV gene mutation analysis revealed homozygous M694V mutation. In addition to azathioprine and cyclosporine therapy, with the diagnosis of FMF, colchicine therapy was started and partial remission was observed within 2 weeks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of association of CD and FMF in an infant. In cases of CD resistant to medical therapy, possibility of underlying FMF should be considered, especially in countries where FMF is prevalent.

Diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy disease in gastrointestinal biopsies. A 14-year-old boy with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease had a lifelong history of failure to thrive and gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, pain, and diarrhea, leading to progressive cachexia. At the age of 9 years, after an extensive workup, the diagnosis of Crohn disease was strongly suspected, and he underwent colonoscopy with multiple biopsies. At 11 years of age, vision change and poor balance lead to a diagnosis of leukodystrophy by magnetic resonance imaging. Investigations for metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenal leukodystrophy, and globoid cell leukodystrophy were all negative. A diagnosis of MNGIE disease was suspected when he continued deteriorating with gastrointestinal symptoms, multiple neurologic deficits, and encephalopathy. Markedly diminished thymidine phosphorylase activity and increased thymidine plasma levels confirmed the diagnosis of MNGIE.

[Diagnostic difficulties in pediatric abdominal pain with potential appendicitis]. Pediatric abdominal pain is one of the most common symptom of children brought to attention of primary care physicians and pediatric surgeons. In many children clinical symptoms may be uncharacteristic and may lead to diagnostic difficulties. Clinical analysis of children with right lower quadrant abdominal pain suspected of appendicitis or children with periappendicular mass. The histories of 14 children aged from 18 months to 17 years treated in Pediatric Clinic were analysed. All children were operated because of right lower quadrant abdominal pain or abdominal mass before admission to the Pediatric Clinic or during hospitalization in Pediatric Clinic. Intraoperatively in all children pathologies other than appendicitis were the cause of symptoms. The most often Crohn's disease were recognized (9 children), in 2 cases with concomitant other pathologies (fecal tumor of appendix in one case and with peritoneal abscess after perforation of intestinal wall). Sporadically the inflammation of the mesenterial lymph nodes caused by Yersinia infection suggested appendicitis. In one boy with ulcerative colitis, during exacerbation of the disease appendicitis complicated by rupture and peritonitis was observed. In 18-month old child with right lower quadrant abdominal mass invagination complicated by perforation of the ileum was recognized. In the case of 14-years old boy 6 months after appendectomy we observed mechanical intestinal obstruction complicated by perforation and peritonitis. Carcinoid of the appendix was the cause of abdominal pain in one child. 1. Appendicitis is the most frequent surgical etiology of the right lower quadrant pediatric abdominal pain. 2. Despite new diagnostic imagines there are no definite criteria to recognize appendicitis, in most cases physical examination and very carefull evaluation of abdominal pain are the most important. 3. All children with periappendipected of Crohn's disease. 4. All children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis and with normal appendix during operation should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

An 18-Year-Old With Acute-on-Chronic Abdominal Pain. An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

A 50-year-old woman who was complaining of abdominal pain was referred to the endocrine clinic after a small (0.8 cm by 0.8 cm) mass was found in her right adrenal gland on CT examination of the abdomen. She had a history of hypertension for 10 years, generalized anxiety disorder for 5 years and a weight increase of 18 kg over the previous 3 years. The patient did not report weakness, polyuria or excessive thirst. She had a history of hypokalemia while on hydrochlorothiazide therapy. To improve blood pressure control, a total of three antihypertensive medications had been sequentially added to her regimen. At presentation, medications included 300 mg irbesartan daily, 5 mg amlodipine daily and 100 mg sustained-release metoprolol daily. Renin activity, levels of plasma aldosterone and levels of fractionated plasma metanephrines were measured and an overnight 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test was performed. In addition, measurements of urine aldosterone excretion on a high-salt diet, MRI-examination of the adrenal glands and bilateral adrenal vein sampling were conducted. An aldosterone-secreting adrenal adenoma. The patient underwent laparoscopic resection of the right adrenal gland, which led to normalization of aldosterone excretion, lowering of her blood pressure on a single antihypertensive medication (50 mg sustained-release metoprolol daily) and resolution of hypokalemia.

[Merits of paracetamol in osteoarthritic hypertensive patients]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) side effects can impair quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis. Due to its particular mechanism of action, paracetamol might bypass these negative effects. To determine both the role of paracetamol in the treatment of osteoarthritis patients and optimal combination of antihypertensives and antirheumatics for these patients. A prospective clinical trial in a family practice included 110 treated hypertensives aged over 55 years: 50 controls and 60 also taking NSAIDs for osteoarthritis. This 3-month study compared two antihypertensives, lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide fixed combination and amlodipine, with two NSAIDs, ibuprofen and piroxicam, and with paracetamol. Following clinical work-up and NSAID discontinuation for at least 3 days (run-in period of only 3-7 days), osteoarthritis subjects were randomized to 1-month periods of ibuprofen (400-600 mg t.i.d.) or piroxicam (10-20 mg o.d.) with one month of paracetamol (1000 mg t.i.d.) in the middle as a "wash-out" interval, continuing the prescribed amlodipine (5-10 mg o.d.) or lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide fixed drug combination (10/6.25-20/12.5 mg o.d.), while control subjects (hypertensives with no osteoarthritis) were just keeping their antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure was measured with standard mercury sphygmomanometer and with an automatic device, in standing, sitting and supine position. The intensity of arthritic pain (on a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10, where 0 means "no pain" and 10 "the worst pain you may imagine") and the patient's quality of life estimate (on a visual analogue scale from 1 to 10, where 0 means "general condition excellent" and 10 "the worst possible") were recorded. Blood pressure control was unchanged in the amiodipine group across the study periods and impaired in the lisinopril/ hydrochlorothiazide group during either ibuprofen or piroxicam, but not during paracetamol. In the amlodipine +/- ibuprofen subgroup, the reduction of the average pain intensity score throughout the study was significant (chi2 = 8.250; df 3; P = 0.037). In the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide +/- piroxicam subgroup, the assessed quality of life differed significantly (chi2 = 9.716; df 3; P = 0.018), while in the amlodipine +/- ibuprofen and amlodipine +/- piroxicam subgroups the changes were marginal (chi2 = 6.936; df 3; P = 0.072 and chi2 = 7146; df 3; P = 0.065, respectively).

[Serum biological markers and screening of viral hepatitis]. The diagnosis of hepatitis A is based on IgM anti-HAV positivity. IgG anti-HAV indicates immunity from further infections of hepatitis A. In acute hepatitis B, HBs Ag is the first marker to appear in the serum, followed by HBe Ag and anti-HBc. After recovery, HBs Ag disappears, anti-HBs appears with anti-HBe and anti-HBc and persists for many years. Anti-HBs is indicative of recovery and immunity. Chronic hepatitis B infection is defined as the persistence of HBs Ag for more than 6 months. The presence of HBeAg and HBV DNA in the serum of HBsAg positive carriers has been considered as indication of active viral replication. After a variable period, often several years, viral replication disappears. The patient displays serum anti-HBe antibodies and HBV DNA is not detected in the serum. This state is the most frequently observed and has been classified as wild type. Mutations have been described. The delta virus is not able to replicate on its own, but is capable of infection when activated by the presence of hepatitis B virus. The appearance of serum IgG anti-delta is the simplest method of diagnosing delta infection. Serological tests for HCV detect antibodies to viral antigens (Elisa assay). Each positive anti-HCV assay must be followed by a complementary confirmation test. The most widely used method for supplementary testing is the recombinant immunoblot assay in which antibodies are sought for recombinant antigens of HCV coated on nitrocellulose strips.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

An Interesting Case of Isolated False-Reactive Hepatitis B Surface Antigen. The standard serologic markers used to diagnose hepatitis B infection include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc). Different markers or combinations of markers are used to identify different phases of HBV infection and determine whether a patient has acute or chronic infection or immunity due to prior infection or vaccination or is seronegative and susceptible to future infection. Isolated HBsAg seropositivity is a peculiar serological pattern that requires investigation. Herein, we present a case of an asymptomatic female without a history of liver disease or evident risk factors for hepatitis, who underwent screening for infectious disease prior to resection of basal cell carcinoma involving her eyelid. The patient's laboratory testing showed positivity for HBsAg and the HIV 1/2 screen. To investigate, we performed serial dilutions, utilized heterophilicantibody blocking tubes, and repeated analysis using a different commercial assay (Abbott Architect i2000), all in support of a false-positive result attributed to a heterophilic antibody. Hence, we demonstrate that heterophilic antibody interference can result in isolated HBsAg positivity and recommend considering this form of interference in the differential where there is low clinical suspicion for viral infection.

[Polyclonal activation due to Epstein-Barr virus superinfection in a case with chronic hepatitis B]. Primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) often occurs subclinically during childhood, resulting in a latent infection of B lymphocytes. In this report, a chronic hepatitis B case who presented with a serologic profile mimicking acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and exhibiting transient autoantibody positivities because of the polyclonal activation of B cells due to EBV reactivation has been presented. The test results of 56 years old male patient who suffered from fatigue and pain on the right upper quadrant, revealed high levels of liver enzymes (AST: 187 U/L, ALT: 569 U/L), positivity of HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG and anti-HBe, and negativity of anti-HBc IgM, HBeAg and anti-HBs. Since HBV-DNA level was found 405,974 copies/mL by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the patient was taken into follow-up. At the 6th month AST and ALT levels further elevated (352 U/L and 609 U/L, respectively), and anti-HBc IgM and anti-HBs became positive in addition to the previous positive markers of HBV. With the suspicion of superinfection, further laboratory investigations yielded negative results in CMV-IgM and Paul Bunnel test, while positive results in EBV anti-VCA IgM and IgG, anti-EBNA IgM and IgG, anti-p22 IgM and IgG and anti-EA IgM. In the follow-up period high levels of autoantibody positivities [rheumatoid factor (42.200 U/ml), anti-nuclear antibody (1/100) and anti-Ro-52] together with increased levels of total IgG, IgM and IgA were detected. In the following months, the levels of transaminases, total immunoglobulins and HBV-DNA have distinctively decreased, and in the 20th month the previous HBV profile regained (HBsAg, anti-HBc IgG and anti-HBe positive, anti-HBc IgM and anti-HBs negative, HBV-DNA: 6984 copies/ml) and the other pathological test results returned to normal. As a result, ALT increases seen during the course of chronic hepatitis B should not always be considered as HBV manifestations and the unusual serologic patterns should be evaluated as a consequence of superinfection with various viral agents.

Hepatitis B in Wisconsin male prisoners: considerations for serologic screening and vaccination. To develop a protocol for prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in Wisconsin prisons, we interviewed 619 male prisoners at incarceration to obtain information on hepatitis B risk factors. We defined previous infections by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to develop a model of relative risk (RR) of HBV infection. Use of illicit intravenous (IV) drugs was the most important risk factor because of a high prevalence of IV drug use and an RR which ranged from 2.93-7.47. Other important risk factors were: prior hepatitis or jaundice (RR = 6.28), race (RR = 2.54 for Blacks, RR = 3.28 for Latinos), transfusion (RR = 3.00), and age. Previous imprisonment was not an independent risk factor for HBV, hence selective serologic screening and vaccination of prisoners are justified rather than mass screening and vaccination. Based upon prevalence of hepatitis B markers in subgroups, it is necessary to screen prisoners with prior hepatitis or jaundice, prior transfusion, and users of IV drugs. The identification of HBsAg carriers by such screening could prevent infection of "household" contacts. Users of IV drugs who are susceptible to HBV infection should be vaccinated. The remaining prisoners constitute a low-risk group for HBV infection and do not require serologic screening or vaccination.

Exertional myalgia syndrome associated with diminished serum ammonia elevation in ischemic exercise testing. A 36-year-old man with chronic severe exertional myalgias had a normal serum lactate elevation and diminished serum ammonia elevation on an ischemic forearm exercise test (IFET). The IFET is commonly performed in the evaluation of patients with complaints of exertional myalgias, cramps, and rhabdomyolysis. The finding of a normal serum lactate elevation and a diminished serum ammonia elevation after ischemic exercise is usually considered indicative of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. However, myoadenylate deaminase activity was normal in this man's muscle biopsy specimen. This case suggests that a diminished serum ammonia elevation in the IFET is not always indicative of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, a disorder of ammonia production. A diminished serum ammonia elevation in the IFET could also reflect an impairment of net ammonia efflux from muscle into blood.

[A 22-year-old man with long-standing weakness and atrophy predominantly in the lower extremities]. We report a right-handed 22-year-old man with muscle atrophy. His prenatal course and the delivery were uneventful, but he walked unsupported at 15 months of the age for the first time. He was apparently well but he was in the slowest group in running in schools. He noted a difficulty in climbing up stairs at 19 years of the age, and he was admitted to our hospital for the work up when he was 22-year-old. His family history and past medical history were unremarkable. On admission, he was a slender and tall guy in no acute distress. General physical examination was unremarkable, but he had high-arched palate and high-arched feet. On neurologic examination, mental status and higher cerebral functions were normal. Cranial nerves appeared intact, however, he had a thin and long face without weakness. The sternocleidomastoid muscles appeared somewhat atrophic and were moderately weak. He was able to walk normally, however, he needed a handrail when he went up stairs. Thigh muscles and triceps surae muscles were atrophic and slightly weak (4/ 5). Muscle tone was hypotonic and no deep tendon reflexes were elicited except for jaw jerk. No ataxia or involuntary movements were seen; sensation was intact. Laboratory examination was unremarkable except for slight increase in serum CK to 145 IU/L. An ischemic forearm exercise test revealed slight elevation of lactate and pyruvate in that base line levels were 5.4 mg/dl and 0.52 mg/dl, respectively, which rose to 11.4 mg/dl and 0.85 mg/dl, respectively, 20 minutes after the initiation of the ischemic exercise. The base line serum ammonia was 102.5 micrograms/dl which decreased to 64.8 micrograms/dl at 20 minutes. A diagnostic biopsy was performed from the left quadriceps femoris muscle. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had nemaline myopathy. Opinions were divided between nemaline myopathy and debranching enzyme deficiency. The results of the ischemic exercise was not typical of glycogen storage disease, but elevations of lactate and pyruvate did not appear to be sufficient to be interpreted as normal. Histologic examination of the biopsied specimen revealed marked type I fiber predominance and abundant nemaline rods. Cytoplasmic bodies were also seen. Histologic characteristics were consistent with the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy. The possibility of concomitant presence of AMP deaminase deficiency was discussed, because serum ammonia did not elevate in the ischemic exercise test.

He suffered muscle atrophy and weakness in his legs as a result of poliomyelitis at the age of 3 yrs. After a stable interval of about 30 yrs, he felt new weakness and fatigue in his legs. Electromyography revealed generalized myotonic discharges, early recruitment, and findings of chronic denervation in his left leg. Genetic testing was consistent with myotonic dystrophy type 1. A biopsy from the right gastrocnemius revealed findings of both myotonic dystrophy and chronic denervation. This case report shows the importance of considering other uncommon conditions in the differential diagnoses of postpolio syndrome.

Context:
Muscle ammonia and amino acid metabolism during dynamic exercise in man. The effect of dynamic exercise on muscle and blood ammonia (NH3) and amino acid contents has been investigated. Eight healthy men cycled at 50% and 97% of maximal oxygen uptake for 10 min and 5.2 min (to fatigue), respectively. Biopsies (quadriceps femoris muscle), arterial and femoral venous blood samples were obtained at rest and during exercise. Muscle NH3 at rest and after submaximal exercise was (means +/- SE) 0.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/kg dry muscle (d.m.) and increased to 4.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/kg d.m. at fatigue (P less than 0.001). The total adenine nucleotide (TAN) pool (TAN = ATP + ADP + AMP) did not change after submaximal exercise but decreased significantly at fatigue (P less than 0.001). The decrease in TAN was similar to the increase in NH3. Muscle lactate was 3 +/- 1 mmol/kg d.m. at rest and increased to 104 +/- 5 mmol/kg d.m. at fatigue. Whole blood and plasma NH3 did not change significantly during submaximal but both increased significantly during maximal exercise (P less than 0.001). During maximal exercise the leg released 7,120 mumol/min of lactate, whereas only 89 mumol/min of NH3 were released. NH3 accumulation in muscle could buffer only 3% of the hydrogen ions released from lactate, and NH3 release could account for only 1% of the net hydrogen ion transport out of the cell. Muscle glutamine was constant throughout the study, whereas glutamate decreased and alanine increased during exercise (P less than 0.001). No significant changes in either arterial whole blood glutamine or glutamate were observed. Arterial plasma glutamine and glutamate concentrations, however, increased and decreased (P less than 0.001), respectively, during exercise. It is concluded that (1) muscle and blood NH3 levels increase only during strenuous exercise and (2) NH3 accumulation is of minor importance for regulating acid-base balance in body fluids during exercise.




Question:
A 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of chronic fatigue and generalized weakness after exertion. His legs feel stiff after walking long distances and he has leg cramps after climbing stairs. His symptoms are always relieved by rest. Urine dipstick shows 3+ blood and urinalysis is negative for RBCs. Baseline venous lactate and serum ammonia levels are collected, after which a blood pressure cuff is attached to the upper right arm. The patient is asked to continuously pump his right arm with the cuff inflated and additional venous samples are collected at 2-minute intervals. Analysis of the venous blood samples shows that, over time, serum ammonia levels increase and venous lactate levels remain stable. A biopsy of the right gastrocnemius muscle will most likely show which of the following?

[A] : Intrafascicular CD8+ lymphocytic infiltration
[B] : Endomysial fibrosis with absent dystrophin
[C] : Intermyofibrillar proliferation of mitochondria

Context:
The relationship between plasma potassium, muscle membrane excitability and force following quadriceps fatigue. To examine the simultaneous changes in plasma [K+], muscle excitability and force during fatigue, ten male adults (mean age = 22 +/- 0.5 years) held an isometric contraction of their right quadriceps muscle at an intensity of 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for 3 min. Femoral venous and brachial arterial [K+] were determined from serial samples drawn before, during, and for 15 min following the 3-min contraction. Each blood sample was synchronized with a maximal stimulation of the right femoral nerve to evoke a twitch and compound muscle action potential (M-wave). Immediately post-exercise, twitch torque was only 42% of baseline and femoral venous plasma [K+] had increased significantly from 4.02 +/- 0.08 mmol/l to 5.9 +/- 0.22 mmol/l. Femoral venous plasma lactate rose to a peak level of 10.0 +/- 0.8 mmol/l at 1 min post exercise. The recovery of the twitch torque was exponentially related to the recovery of femoral venous plasma [K+] (r2 = 0.93, P &lt; 0.01). There was no evidence for any loss of muscle membrane excitability during the period of increased extracellular [K+], in fact, the M-waves tended to be potentiated in the early phases of the recovery period. These results suggest that muscle membrane excitability is maintained in spite of increased extracellular [K+] following fatigue induced by a sustained submaximal quadriceps contraction. However, the strong relationship between twitch torque and femoral venous plasma [K+] suggests that K+ may be exerting its effect distal to surface membrane action potential propagation, most likely in the T-tubular region.

Context:
Exertional myalgia syndrome associated with diminished serum ammonia elevation in ischemic exercise testing. A 36-year-old man with chronic severe exertional myalgias had a normal serum lactate elevation and diminished serum ammonia elevation on an ischemic forearm exercise test (IFET). The IFET is commonly performed in the evaluation of patients with complaints of exertional myalgias, cramps, and rhabdomyolysis. The finding of a normal serum lactate elevation and a diminished serum ammonia elevation after ischemic exercise is usually considered indicative of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. However, myoadenylate deaminase activity was normal in this man's muscle biopsy specimen. This case suggests that a diminished serum ammonia elevation in the IFET is not always indicative of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, a disorder of ammonia production. A diminished serum ammonia elevation in the IFET could also reflect an impairment of net ammonia efflux from muscle into blood.


[A 22-year-old man with long-standing weakness and atrophy predominantly in the lower extremities]. We report a right-handed 22-year-old man with muscle atrophy. His prenatal course and the delivery were uneventful, but he walked unsupported at 15 months of the age for the first time. He was apparently well but he was in the slowest group in running in schools. He noted a difficulty in climbing up stairs at 19 years of the age, and he was admitted to our hospital for the work up when he was 22-year-old. His family history and past medical history were unremarkable. On admission, he was a slender and tall guy in no acute distress. General physical examination was unremarkable, but he had high-arched palate and high-arched feet. On neurologic examination, mental status and higher cerebral functions were normal. Cranial nerves appeared intact, however, he had a thin and long face without weakness. The sternocleidomastoid muscles appeared somewhat atrophic and were moderately weak. He was able to walk normally, however, he needed a handrail when he went up stairs. Thigh muscles and triceps surae muscles were atrophic and slightly weak (4/ 5). Muscle tone was hypotonic and no deep tendon reflexes were elicited except for jaw jerk. No ataxia or involuntary movements were seen; sensation was intact. Laboratory examination was unremarkable except for slight increase in serum CK to 145 IU/L. An ischemic forearm exercise test revealed slight elevation of lactate and pyruvate in that base line levels were 5.4 mg/dl and 0.52 mg/dl, respectively, which rose to 11.4 mg/dl and 0.85 mg/dl, respectively, 20 minutes after the initiation of the ischemic exercise. The base line serum ammonia was 102.5 micrograms/dl which decreased to 64.8 micrograms/dl at 20 minutes. A diagnostic biopsy was performed from the left quadriceps femoris muscle. The patient was discussed in a neurologic CPC, and the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had nemaline myopathy. Opinions were divided between nemaline myopathy and debranching enzyme deficiency. The results of the ischemic exercise was not typical of glycogen storage disease, but elevations of lactate and pyruvate did not appear to be sufficient to be interpreted as normal. Histologic examination of the biopsied specimen revealed marked type I fiber predominance and abundant nemaline rods. Cytoplasmic bodies were also seen. Histologic characteristics were consistent with the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy. The possibility of concomitant presence of AMP deaminase deficiency was discussed, because serum ammonia did not elevate in the ischemic exercise test.

Myotonic dystrophy mimicking postpolio syndrome in a polio survivor. We describe a 38-yr-old polio survivor with newly developed weakness from myotonic dystrophy. He suffered muscle atrophy and weakness in his legs as a result of poliomyelitis at the age of 3 yrs. After a stable interval of about 30 yrs, he felt new weakness and fatigue in his legs. Electromyography revealed generalized myotonic discharges, early recruitment, and findings of chronic denervation in his left leg. Genetic testing was consistent with myotonic dystrophy type 1. A biopsy from the right gastrocnemius revealed findings of both myotonic dystrophy and chronic denervation. This case report shows the importance of considering other uncommon conditions in the differential diagnoses of postpolio syndrome.

A red face in a lupus patient: thinking beyond lupus rash. A 61-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a facial rash followed by fever. The diagnosis of lupus flare was made by the general practioner who prescribed corticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable and the patient was hospitalized. On admission, she presented with high fever and a sharply demarcated papular erythema overlying her cheeks. Biology was inflammatory with elevated C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate and leucocyte count. The diagnosis of erysipelas of the face was made on the basis of the malar and non pruritic papular erythema, fever, the high C-reactive protein levels and the absence of response to corticosteroids. The evolution was favorable under intravenous antibiotics and rapid tapering of the corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of facial erysipelas in a patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus. This coincidence is a rare condition which may lead to erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate therapy.

Summertime and the patient is itchy. A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 36âh history of a painful, itchy maculopapular rash and associated vesicles to his arms and neck. He had no history of exposure to new chemicals or hygiene products and no significant medical history. His physiological observations were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. On close inspection the rash was noted to be present only on areas of skin exposed while wearing a polo shirt. On further questioning it transpired that he had been gardening 12âh prior to the development of the rash. A diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made. The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in future. Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction caused by contact with light-sensitising compounds found in plants and exposure to ultraviolet A radiation. It is self-limiting and can be managed symptomatically.

Photoallergic reaction to cyamemazine. A 50-year-old man presented with a scaly erythema of the face, upper chest, forearms, and dorsum of the hands. He has been treated with cyamemazine for 6 months. Photopatch tests were performed and the patient was diagnosed with photoallergic reaction to cyamemazine. The drug was discontinued and a course of oral steroids was prescribed. The patient was advised to avoid light exposure. There has been no evidence of recurrence during a six-month follow-up period. Photoallergic reactions are much less frequent than phototoxic disorders. It is well known that several drugs including neuroleptics of the phenothiazine family may produce a skin eruption on light-exposed areas by dose-dependent (phototoxic) or photoallergic mechanisms. It is believed that photopatch testing, which is the clinical investigation of choice for suspected photoallergic reactions, is significantly underused in Europe and probably world-wide.

Context:
A red face in a lupus patient: thinking beyond lupus rash. A 61-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a facial rash followed by fever. The diagnosis of lupus flare was made by the general practioner who prescribed corticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable and the patient was hospitalized. On admission, she presented with high fever and a sharply demarcated papular erythema overlying her cheeks. Biology was inflammatory with elevated C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate and leucocyte count. The diagnosis of erysipelas of the face was made on the basis of the malar and non pruritic papular erythema, fever, the high C-reactive protein levels and the absence of response to corticosteroids. The evolution was favorable under intravenous antibiotics and rapid tapering of the corticosteroids. To our knowledge, this is the first report of facial erysipelas in a patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus. This coincidence is a rare condition which may lead to erroneous diagnosis and inappropriate therapy.


Summertime and the patient is itchy. A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 36âh history of a painful, itchy maculopapular rash and associated vesicles to his arms and neck. He had no history of exposure to new chemicals or hygiene products and no significant medical history. His physiological observations were normal and systemic examination was unremarkable. On close inspection the rash was noted to be present only on areas of skin exposed while wearing a polo shirt. On further questioning it transpired that he had been gardening 12âh prior to the development of the rash. A diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made. The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in future. Phytophotodermatitis is a cutaneous reaction caused by contact with light-sensitising compounds found in plants and exposure to ultraviolet A radiation. It is self-limiting and can be managed symptomatically.




Question:
A 59-year-old man comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on his face and hands, which developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. He wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when he does not apply sunscreen. The patient was diagnosed with small cell lung carcinoma 2 months ago and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. He is currently taking demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. He has also had occasional back pain. He takes zolpidem and drinks 1–2 glasses of brandy before going to sleep every night. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. His pulse is 72/min and his blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows prominent erythema on his forehead, cheeks, and neck. Erythema and papular eruptions are seen on the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

[A] : Uroporphyrin accumulation
[B] : Systemic lupus erythematosus

Photoallergic reaction to cyamemazine. A 50-year-old man presented with a scaly erythema of the face, upper chest, forearms, and dorsum of the hands. He has been treated with cyamemazine for 6 months. Photopatch tests were performed and the patient was diagnosed with photoallergic reaction to cyamemazine. The drug was discontinued and a course of oral steroids was prescribed. The patient was advised to avoid light exposure. There has been no evidence of recurrence during a six-month follow-up period. Photoallergic reactions are much less frequent than phototoxic disorders. It is well known that several drugs including neuroleptics of the phenothiazine family may produce a skin eruption on light-exposed areas by dose-dependent (phototoxic) or photoallergic mechanisms. It is believed that photopatch testing, which is the clinical investigation of choice for suspected photoallergic reactions, is significantly underused in Europe and probably world-wide.

A seizure-induced T8 burst fracture re-presenting as an acute abdomen. A male aged 44âyears presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of intermittent right-sided abdominal pain radiating to the midline. Examination demonstrated a tender right upper quadrant with voluntary guarding and a low grade fever. One week previously, he had been admitted to hospital after an isolated, self-terminating seizure secondary to an deliberate venlafaxine overdose. His upper abdominal symptoms started immediately postseizure but at the time were attributed to musculoskeletal chest pain by the discharging team. Acute cholecystitis was suspected, but liver function tests, amylase and an erect chest radiograph were unremarkable.The abdominal pain responded well to morphine, permitting a thorough reassessment of the patient, which revealed midthoracic spine tenderness, previously undetected. Prior to this, the patient had not complained of any back pain. A CT scan confirmed a burst fracture of T8 requiring urgent transfer to the local spinal unit for posterior stabilisation.

An evidence-based approach to emergency ultrasound. Paramedics bring into the ED an elderly man who is complaining of right-sided chest and abdominal pain. Earlier this morning, a friend had arrived at the patient's home and found him on the floor at the bottom of the stairs. The patient is in pain, somewhat altered, and unable to provide further details about what happened. After numerous attempts, the paramedics were only able to place a 22-gauge peripheral line. On examination, his blood pressure is 98/55 mm Hg, heart rate is 118 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation is 94% on a nonrebreather, and temperature is 36.0 degrees C (96.8 degrees F). His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 12 (eyes 3, verbal 4, motor 5). Given the unclear events surrounding his presentation and the concern for trauma, the patient is boarded and collared. His chest is stable but tender, and because of noise in the resuscitation room, you have difficulty auscultating breath sounds. The abdominal examination is notable for marked tenderness over the right upper quadrant and right flank, with some guarding. There is also mild asymmetric swelling of his right lower extremity. The patient is critically ill, his history is limited, and at this point the differential is quite broad. You consider the possibility of a syncopal episode followed by a fall, with a closed head injury, blunt thoracic trauma, and blunt abdominal trauma. His hypotension could be secondary to hypovolemia (dehydration or blood loss due to a ruptured aortic aneurysm), heart failure (left- or right-sided dysfunction), cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, or sepsis. Your ED recently purchased an ultrasound machine, you wonder whether bedside ultrasound can help narrow the differential and guide your resuscitation. You call over one of your new faculty members who just finished resident training; a fortunate decision for both you and the patient.

Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury with "negative" cervical spine CT scan. A 46-year-old man fell four steps, striking his neck and having associated neck pain and discomfort. He was evaluated at a local emergency department and reported no neurological deficit but focal mid cervical tenderness. Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scan were "negative" for cervical spine fracture, dislocation or pre-vertebral soft tissue swelling. He was discharged home in a cervical collar with a scheduled outpatient follow-up. Over the proceeding hours neurologic deterioration occurred, including hand and lower limb weakness with the inability to urinate. The patient returned to the local emergency room and was transferred to a tertiary care hospital where examination revealed C5ASIAB deficits. Repeat high resolution CT scan of the cervical spine with reformatted images was unremarkable for osseous fractures except some loss of definition in the posterior cervical musculature. Emergency magnetic resonance imaging MRI revealed a subluxation of C5/6 right facet (not evident on CT) with disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamentum flavum, and disc space with abnormal T2 weighted spinal cord hyperintense signal at C5/6. He underwent emergency C5-C6 anterior and posterior decompression and fusion. One week later an examination showed improved C5ASIAD. This case reveals the difficulty of assessing the cervical spine for instability and potential limitations of current management schemes.

Occult primary head and neck carcinoma. Unknown primary carcinoma presenting as cervical lymph node metastasis accounts for approximately 5% of all head and neck malignancies. The typical presentation involves a middle-aged man with a painless neck mass that has been present for several months. Over 90% of these malignancies represent squamous cell carcinoma originating within Waldeyer's ring (lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx, tonsil, and base of tongue). The remainder are comprised of adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and other rare histologic variants. The ability to identify the occult primary tumor is imperative because identification allows site-specific therapy and avoidance of wide-field radiation side effects. Following confirmation of metastatic cervical disease with fine-needle aspiration, all patients presenting with an unknown primary carcinoma require a thorough head and neck history and physical examination, radiographic imaging, panendoscopy with directed biopsies of Waldeyer's ring, and bilateral tonsillectomy. Positron emission tomography has proved helpful in identifying occult primary tumors of the head and neck region.

HIV exposure through contact with body fluids. A variety of situations, either accidental or linked to high-risk behaviour, raise concerns about potential infection from contact with the blood or genital secretions of a person who may be HIV-infected. Antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis is offered to prevent establishment of HIV infection. As of 2011, what is the evidence for the efficacy of antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis? Under what circumstances is this treatment justified? To answer these questions, we reviewed the available evidence, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. The evidence for the efficacy of rapidly initiated prophylaxis following exposure comes mainly from one case-control study on health professionals injured while treating HIV-positive patients. Treatment with zidovudine for 3 to 4 weeks was associated with a risk of HIV seroconversion that was 5 times lower than among those not treated. The main clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of antiretroviral treatments that are already well established for chronic HIV infection as post-exposure prophylaxis. A typical regimen combines HIV-protease inhibitors (ideally lopinavir + ritonavir) with a fixed-dose combination of two nucleoside (or nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (emtricitabine + tenofovir or lamivudine + zidovudine). Certain antiretrovirals are best avoided as first-choice therapy due to their adverse effects: abacavir due to the risk of serious allergic reactions; atazanavir due to the risk of jaundice and torsades de pointes. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as efavirenz) frequently cause adverse cutaneous and neurosensory adverse effects, especially during the first weeks of treatment. The main adverse effects of antiretrovirals are gastrointestinal. Diarrhoea is common with lopinavir. Antiretrovirals interact with many other drugs. HIV-protease inhibitors reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. The Iopinavir + ritonavir + zidovudine + lamivudine combination has been used for a long time to treat pregnant women. No evidence of teratogenicity has been shown.The antiretrovirals atazanavir, emtricitabine, nelfinavir, nevirapine and tenofovir can also be used but there is less experience with their use during pregnancy. Post-exposure treatment should be started as soon as possible: wash and rinse the wound; initiate antiretroviral therapy within 48 to 72 hours, without waiting to obtain all the information required for risk assessment; reassess the infection risk 2 to 4 days later. Risk assessment should be based on the type and circumstances of exposure, and the source person's serological HIV status and viral load if the individual is known to be HIV-infected and receiving treatment.This information should be obtained urgently or estimated on the basis of HIV infection is still possible despite post-exposure prophylaxis.Therefore, in order to avoid transmitting the virus to others, anyone exposed and potentially infected should be advised against unprotected sex or blood donation for 3 months, until serological evidence has been obtained that they have not been infected. In practice, the many situations in which the risk of infection is uncertain should be managed on a case-by-case basis, with the patient's involvement, weighing the probability of HIV transmission against the adverse effects of a one-month course of antiretroviral therapy.

Post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines for children and adolescents potentially exposed to HIV. UK guidelines for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in adults have recently been updated. Indications for PEP have been modified and there has been a change in the recommended antiretroviral therapy for adults to a combination of raltegravir with tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada). Raltegravir and tenofovir are now available in paediatric formulations and offer improved safety and tolerability over previously recommended ritonavir-boosted lopinavir with zidovudine. This guideline provides recommendations for those caring for children potentially exposed to HIV and other bloodborne viruses in primary care, emergency departments, secondary care and specialist paediatric HIV centres.

Tenofovir DF/emtricitabine/rilpivirine as HIV post-exposure prophylaxis: results from a multicentre prospective study. Since 2016, French guidelines have recommended the single-tablet regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/rilpivirine (RPV) as HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but few data support this usage. We evaluated the tolerability, treatment completion and occurrence of HIV seroconversion associated with this combination in occupational and non-occupational PEP. We conducted an observational, prospective, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized study in five French HIV centres. Adults requiring PEP according to national French guidelines were prescribed TDF/FTC/RPV one pill once a day for 28âdays. Clinical and biological tolerability was assessed at week 4; occurrence of HIV seroconversion was evaluated after week 16. From March 2016 to March 2017, 163 courses of PEP were prescribed for 150 sexual exposures (44% heterosexual and 56% MSM) and 13 non-sexual exposures. Five participants stopped PEP after a few days because the source person was HIV uninfected. Of the remaining 158 individuals, 15 (9.5%) were lost to follow-up at week 4, 7 (4.4%) prematurely discontinued PEP [patient's decision/non-adherence (nâ=â3) or adverse events (gastrointestinal intolerance nâ=â3, fatigue nâ=â1)] and 136 (86.1%) completed the 28âday treatment. Overall, 69.6% of participants declared at least one adverse event, mostly of mild to moderate intensity and no serious adverse events or hepatic or renal toxicity occurred. No HIV seroconversion occurred at week 16. The low rate of premature treatment interruption, the good tolerability and the absence of documented HIV seroconversion support the current French guidelines of a 28âday course of TDF/FTC/RPV for sexual and non-sexual PEP.

Context:
Practical guidance for nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection: an editorial review. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiretroviral medication has been used as an HIV-prevention strategy for nearly 20 years. The fact that approximately 50 000 new HIV infections occur in the United States each year reflects marked underutilization of nonoccupational PEP (NPEP). There have been several advances in NPEP in the past 10 years. Clinical trials from different countries have demonstrated better tolerability, completion rates, and fewer drug-drug interactions with newer antiretroviral agents. Notably, there has been a shift from zidovudine-based to tenofovir-based regimens. Three-drug therapy is now favored for all potential HIV exposures. More recently, the US Public Health Service and the New York State Department of Health recommended tenofovir/emtricitabine and raltegravir as the first-line regimen universally for PEP. Advances in HIV testing technology may also allow shorter duration of follow-up HIV testing after a high-risk exposure. This review will discuss challenges with previously recommended regimens, newer potential candidate agents and the rationale for using them, intervals for laboratory monitoring, and cost considerations for NPEP. NPEP can be viewed as an educable moment and a potential bridge to preexposure prophylaxis, as part of a combination prevention package, for those who are likely to have recurrent higher-risk exposures. Thus, risk-reduction counseling should be an integral aspect of NPEP.

Haemodynamic crisis and reversible multiorgan failure caused by HIV post-exposure prophylaxis after needle-stick injury in a health care worker. We report the case of a 59-year-old nurse from our HIV ward who developed a severe haemodynamic crisis with concomitant acute multiorgan failure after initiation of a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with zidovudine/lamivudine (CombivirTM) and lopinavir/ritonavir (KaletraTM) after a needle-stick injury with an HIV-contaminated needle. Although serious and life-threatening adverse effects of post-exposure prophylaxis have been documented in several cases, this is the first report of a severe acute cardiovascular incident following PEP initiation.


HIV exposure through contact with body fluids. A variety of situations, either accidental or linked to high-risk behaviour, raise concerns about potential infection from contact with the blood or genital secretions of a person who may be HIV-infected. Antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis is offered to prevent establishment of HIV infection. As of 2011, what is the evidence for the efficacy of antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis? Under what circumstances is this treatment justified? To answer these questions, we reviewed the available evidence, based on the standard Prescrire methodology. The evidence for the efficacy of rapidly initiated prophylaxis following exposure comes mainly from one case-control study on health professionals injured while treating HIV-positive patients. Treatment with zidovudine for 3 to 4 weeks was associated with a risk of HIV seroconversion that was 5 times lower than among those not treated. The main clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of antiretroviral treatments that are already well established for chronic HIV infection as post-exposure prophylaxis. A typical regimen combines HIV-protease inhibitors (ideally lopinavir + ritonavir) with a fixed-dose combination of two nucleoside (or nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitors (emtricitabine + tenofovir or lamivudine + zidovudine). Certain antiretrovirals are best avoided as first-choice therapy due to their adverse effects: abacavir due to the risk of serious allergic reactions; atazanavir due to the risk of jaundice and torsades de pointes. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as efavirenz) frequently cause adverse cutaneous and neurosensory adverse effects, especially during the first weeks of treatment. The main adverse effects of antiretrovirals are gastrointestinal. Diarrhoea is common with lopinavir. Antiretrovirals interact with many other drugs. HIV-protease inhibitors reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. The Iopinavir + ritonavir + zidovudine + lamivudine combination has been used for a long time to treat pregnant women. No evidence of teratogenicity has been shown.The antiretrovirals atazanavir, emtricitabine, nelfinavir, nevirapine and tenofovir can also be used but there is less experience with their use during pregnancy. Post-exposure treatment should be started as soon as possible: wash and rinse the wound; initiate antiretroviral therapy within 48 to 72 hours, without waiting to obtain all the information required for risk assessment; reassess the infection risk 2 to 4 days later. Risk assessment should be based on the type and circumstances of exposure, and the source person's serological HIV status and viral load if the individual is known to be HIV-infected and receiving treatment.This information should be obtained urgently or estimated on the basis of HIV infection is still possible despite post-exposure prophylaxis.Therefore, in order to avoid transmitting the virus to others, anyone exposed and potentially infected should be advised against unprotected sex or blood donation for 3 months, until serological evidence has been obtained that they have not been infected. In practice, the many situations in which the risk of infection is uncertain should be managed on a case-by-case basis, with the patient's involvement, weighing the probability of HIV transmission against the adverse effects of a one-month course of antiretroviral therapy.

Post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines for children and adolescents potentially exposed to HIV. UK guidelines for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in adults have recently been updated. Indications for PEP have been modified and there has been a change in the recommended antiretroviral therapy for adults to a combination of raltegravir with tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada). Raltegravir and tenofovir are now available in paediatric formulations and offer improved safety and tolerability over previously recommended ritonavir-boosted lopinavir with zidovudine. This guideline provides recommendations for those caring for children potentially exposed to HIV and other bloodborne viruses in primary care, emergency departments, secondary care and specialist paediatric HIV centres.

Fatal cutaneous mucormycosis after kidney transplant. Mucormycosis is an uncommon opportunistic infection that is caused by Mucorales from the Zygomycetes class. Patients with severe immunodeficiency admitted to the hospital are at greatest risk for developing this infection. Mucormycosis usually is transmitted in humans by inhalation or inoculation of spores in the skin or mucous membranes. A 66-year-old man developed a surgical wound infection at 1 week after kidney transplant that did not improve despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement. He was transferred to our hospital 45 days after transplant and had fever and a large purulent wound that was surrounded by a black necrotizing margin. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued and the dosage of prednisolone was decreased. Massive debridement was performed but was incomplete because he had full-thickness abdominal wall necrosis. Histopathology showed broad fungal hyphae without septation, consistent with the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Despite antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and additional debridement, the patient died of septic shock at 52 days after kidney transplant. Cutaneous fungal infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any nonhealing infected wound that does not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in patients with predisposing risk factors such as transplant.

Successful treatment of mucormycosis peritonitis with liposomal amphotericin B in a patient on long-term peritoneal dialysis. A 42-year-old man, with a history of immunoglobulin A nephropathy, underwent a living-related kidney transplant. Allograft function progressively deteriorated secondary to chronic rejection and recurrence of IgA nephropathy, and he returned to peritoneal dialysis after 5 years of the transplant. Fifteen months after the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy, Eschericia coli peritonitis developed, which was treated with ceftazidime intraperitoneally; he received fluconazole as prophylactic antifungal therapy during this period. After completing his course of treatment, abdominal pain occurred with an increased peritoneal fluid white blood cell count. Peritoneal fluid cultures were negative. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluconazole with no appreciable response. After removal of the Tenckoff catheter, peritoneal fluid cultures grew a zygomycete. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) intravenously for 6 weeks. He had episodes of recurrent intraabdominal abscesses requiring surgical drainage and antibiotics. A second course of liposomal amphotericin B was administered for histopathologic evidence of filamentous fungal recurrence. After 5 months, the patient remains well without any evidence of infection.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. Antiglomerular basement membrane disease. A 47-year-old Taiwanese man with no notable medical history was admitted with low-grade fevers and night sweats that had persisted for 5 to 6 weeks. An extensive investigation at another hospital could not determine the cause of the fevers, but documented acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen level of 60 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL. He was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation.The patient, who had been living in the United States for the past 20 years, reported no recent travel and no behaviors that are associated with transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. He was not taking any medications, and he denied using herbal or nutritional supplements. He had no recent weight loss. There were no specific complaints on review of systems. On physical examination, he was a thin, middle-aged man in no distress. Vital signs included a temperature of 37.5 degrees C, a blood pressure of 166/86 mm Hg, a pulse of 70 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. Sclera were anicteric, and he had no palpable adenopathy. His lungs were clear, and his heart rate was regular without extra sounds. His abdomen was thin, nontender, and without masses or organomegaly. There was no edema or signs of embolism in the extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 14,200/mL(3), a hematocrit of 23.1%, and a platelet count of 456,000/mL(3). Blood chemistries were notable for a blood urea nitrogen level of 61 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 7.6 mg/dL. Levels of aminotransferases, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. Urinalysis revealed large hemoglobin, 1+ protein, numerous red blood cells, and 3 to 5 white blood cells. Numerous red blood cell casts were seen on microscopic examination of the urine sediment.

[Perioperative agranulocytosis induced by immunosuppressants in a renal graft recipient : a case report]. A 20-year-old man with end-stage renal disease was scheduled to have an ABO-incompatible living kidney transplantation donated by his mother. His complete blood count including differential white blood cell count was normal before preoperative immunosuppressive therapy including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus (FK506), and prednisolone was started 3 weeks before the operation. The dosage of MMF was initially 2,000 mg/day, but was reduced to 500 mg/day due to diarrhea 10 days before the operation. He received rituximab 13 days before the operation. The neutrophil (Neu) count was 3,100/Î¼l a day before the operation. Transplant surgery was finished without any complications. The Neu count was found to be 300/Î¼l on the day and 80/Î¼l the next day. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered daily. Then the Neu count increased to 9,100/Î¼l on postoperative day (POD) 2, and was maintained within the normal range. MMF was re-started on POD 12. The dosage was 500 mg, and was increased to 1,000 mg on POD 21. On POD 30 the 12-hr blood concentration of MMF was 117.2 mgÃ hr/l, which was almost double the adequate target dose. Then the dosage was reduced to 500 mg. In this case MMF is the most suspected drug for drug-induced agranulocytosis. Although MMF-induced neutropenia is frequently observed in transplant recipients, it usually happens three months after transplantation or later. The present case is a rare case as it occurred on the day of transplantation. The pharmacokinetics of MMF varies with the individual. Although routine monitoring of blood concentration of MMF is not recommended, specific attention to prevent overdosage should be given particularly in a patient presenting possible adverse effects including diarrhea and depilation.

Large granular lymphocyte leukemia with pure red cell aplasia in a renal transplant recipient. Neoplastic disorders sometimes accompany a renal transplant. Herein, we report a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia patient with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after renal transplantation. A 36-year-old female was presented to our department with anemia in February 1996. She had undergone hemodialysis because of pregnancy in December 1981. She received a renal transplantation from her mother in April 1986. After the transplantation, she received cyclosporin A (CyA) at 2 mg/kg/day, mizoribine at 1 mg/kg/day, and methylprednisolone at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 8 years. In July 1995, her hemoglobin level dropped to 9.3 g/dl, and anemia developed gradually. In January 1996, her hemoglobin was 5.8 g/dl, and she was given a red blood cell transfusion. Laboratory findings were as follows: RBC 1.46 x 10(12)/L; hemoglobin 5.8 g/dl; hematocrit 17.8%; leucocytes 5.2 x 10(9)/L with 62.4% neutrophils, 34.1% lymphocytes, 2.6% monocytes; platelets 50.8 x 10(10)/L; reticulocytes 0.4%. Bone marrow aspirate smears and biopsy sections revealed normal myeloid and megakaryocyte differentiation with few erythroid precursors. The lymphocytes were of medium size with granules in the cytoplasm. More than 90% of lymphocytes were of the LGL type. Surface markers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated increases in the CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, and CD8+ populations. A monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain gene was found by Southern blot analysis of the mononuclear cells in peripheral blood. A diagnosis of LGL leukemia with PRCA was made. During the next 4 months, she received six red blood cell transfusions, a total of 12 U. In March 1996, the patient was treated with cyclophosphamide (1 mg/kg/day). After 1 month of treatment, serum GPT levels increased to 60 IU/l. The dose of cyclophosphamide was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day. Two months after initiation of the therapy, the patient developed reticulocytosis and blood transfusion was not needed thereafter. During remission, the number of CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, and CD8+ lymphocytes decreased. Large granular lymphocytes decreased to less than 10% of peripheral blood. The monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR-beta chain gene in peripheral blood disappeared.




Question:
A 55-year-old man, who underwent a kidney transplant 2 years ago, presents in septic shock. He is compliant with his immunosuppressive therapy. He does not use any drugs and is sexually active with one male partner. His complete blood count returns as follows: Hemoglobin: 13.7 g/dL, white blood cell count: 4000 cells/microliter, platelets 250,000 cells/microliter. Of note, from his differential: neutrophils: 10%, lymphocytes: 45%, and monocytes: 7%. His basic metabolic profile is notable for a creatinine remaining at his baseline of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient is started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but his condition does not improve. Fungal blood cultures are obtained and grow Candida species. Which of the following was the most-likely predisposing factor?

[A] : Defective IL-2 receptor
[B] : Decreased phagocytic cell count
[C] : Failure to take suppressive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy
[D] : Renal failure

Context:
Fatal cutaneous mucormycosis after kidney transplant. Mucormycosis is an uncommon opportunistic infection that is caused by Mucorales from the Zygomycetes class. Patients with severe immunodeficiency admitted to the hospital are at greatest risk for developing this infection. Mucormycosis usually is transmitted in humans by inhalation or inoculation of spores in the skin or mucous membranes. A 66-year-old man developed a surgical wound infection at 1 week after kidney transplant that did not improve despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement. He was transferred to our hospital 45 days after transplant and had fever and a large purulent wound that was surrounded by a black necrotizing margin. Immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued and the dosage of prednisolone was decreased. Massive debridement was performed but was incomplete because he had full-thickness abdominal wall necrosis. Histopathology showed broad fungal hyphae without septation, consistent with the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Despite antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and additional debridement, the patient died of septic shock at 52 days after kidney transplant. Cutaneous fungal infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any nonhealing infected wound that does not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in patients with predisposing risk factors such as transplant.


Successful treatment of mucormycosis peritonitis with liposomal amphotericin B in a patient on long-term peritoneal dialysis. A 42-year-old man, with a history of immunoglobulin A nephropathy, underwent a living-related kidney transplant. Allograft function progressively deteriorated secondary to chronic rejection and recurrence of IgA nephropathy, and he returned to peritoneal dialysis after 5 years of the transplant. Fifteen months after the discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy, Eschericia coli peritonitis developed, which was treated with ceftazidime intraperitoneally; he received fluconazole as prophylactic antifungal therapy during this period. After completing his course of treatment, abdominal pain occurred with an increased peritoneal fluid white blood cell count. Peritoneal fluid cultures were negative. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluconazole with no appreciable response. After removal of the Tenckoff catheter, peritoneal fluid cultures grew a zygomycete. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) intravenously for 6 weeks. He had episodes of recurrent intraabdominal abscesses requiring surgical drainage and antibiotics. A second course of liposomal amphotericin B was administered for histopathologic evidence of filamentous fungal recurrence. After 5 months, the patient remains well without any evidence of infection.

Cases from the Osler Medical Service at Johns Hopkins University. Antiglomerular basement membrane disease. A 47-year-old Taiwanese man with no notable medical history was admitted with low-grade fevers and night sweats that had persisted for 5 to 6 weeks. An extensive investigation at another hospital could not determine the cause of the fevers, but documented acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen level of 60 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL. He was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation.The patient, who had been living in the United States for the past 20 years, reported no recent travel and no behaviors that are associated with transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. He was not taking any medications, and he denied using herbal or nutritional supplements. He had no recent weight loss. There were no specific complaints on review of systems. On physical examination, he was a thin, middle-aged man in no distress. Vital signs included a temperature of 37.5 degrees C, a blood pressure of 166/86 mm Hg, a pulse of 70 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. Sclera were anicteric, and he had no palpable adenopathy. His lungs were clear, and his heart rate was regular without extra sounds. His abdomen was thin, nontender, and without masses or organomegaly. There was no edema or signs of embolism in the extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 14,200/mL(3), a hematocrit of 23.1%, and a platelet count of 456,000/mL(3). Blood chemistries were notable for a blood urea nitrogen level of 61 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 7.6 mg/dL. Levels of aminotransferases, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. Urinalysis revealed large hemoglobin, 1+ protein, numerous red blood cells, and 3 to 5 white blood cells. Numerous red blood cell casts were seen on microscopic examination of the urine sediment. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate was &gt;130 mm/h, and his C-reactive protein level was elevated at 12.6 mg/dL. Serologies were negative for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; serum complement levels were normal. What is the diagnosis?

Anesthetic management for cesarean section in a patient with uncorrected double-outlet right ventricle. We describe the anesthetic management for cesarean section in a pregnant woman with uncorrected double-outlet right ventricle. The anesthetic method, treatment of complications and lessons are discussed. A 28-year-old woman visited our emergency room for progressive dyspnea and recurrent hemoptysis at 30Â weeks' gestation. Her New York Heart Association functional class was III-IV. Echocardiography indicated that she had congenital heart disease of double-outlet right ventricle. She hadn't received any treatment. The obstetrician decided to terminate the pregnancy by cesarean section. We chose epidural anesthesia and pumped phenylephrine at the same time to minimize hemodynamic fluctuation. Just in the process of changing position to supine position with uterus displaced to the left, the patient coughed badly and complained about dyspnea. At the same time, the oxygen saturation decreased quickly. The symptoms were ameliorated soon by treating as heart failure. But the symptoms reappeared after oxytocin administration. At the end of surgery, the baby was sent to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for premature birth. The mother recovered successfully and discharged 7Â days later. Double-outlet right ventricleÂ is a seldom disease and pregnancy with uncorrectedÂ double-outlet right ventricleÂ is rare.Â In this case, the patient belonged to the type of ventricular septal defect characterized by subaortic ventricular septal defect without pulmonary stenosis.Â Most of the aorta arises from the right ventricle, the volume of venous blood was injected from the right ventricle into the aorta, which decided the oxygen saturations.Â Compared to general anesthesia, epidural anesthesia reduces venous return and alleviates the cardiac burden.Â So, we pumped phenylephrine along with epidural anesthesia in case of critical cyanosis following significant blood pressure decrease. In the process of anesthesia, dyspnea, cough and cyanosis attacked the patient for two times. The most probable reason was heart failure which induced by the sudden increasing of returned blood. As a result of severe cough, pulmonary artery pressure increased rapidly. Then a great amount ofÂ venous blood was injected into the aorta and cyanosis became more serious as well as oxygen saturation declined quickly. Epidural anesthesia with continuous phenylephrine infusion is a preferable choice for parturient women with uncorrected double-outlet right ventricle for cesarean section. It is not the optimal choice for this type of patients to lie on the left. The dose of oxytocin should be reduced to avoid potential cardiovascular complications.

[Right ventricular thrombus mimicking a tumor mass in a newborn with pulmonary atresia--an autopsy report]. Intracardiac masses in infancy are not common. Tumors, thrombi and vegetations of bacterial endocarditis are exceedingly rare in this age group. These masses are seldom diagnosed before the infant's death. Two-dimensional echocardiography is a noninvasive technique that can detect and differentiate intracardiac masses that occur in infants. It can serially detect changes in the size or location of the masses, thus guiding subsequent medical or surgical intervention. An 11-day-old male newborn had suffered from lip and finger nail cyanosis, and dyspnea since 2 days old. Physical examination revealed subcostal retractions and no heart murmur during admission but a grade II/VI systolic murmur with a sometime grade II/VI continuous murmur which could be heard at the left upper sternal border 3 days after admission. The liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. The electrocardiogram was normal. The chest X-ray showed a normal sized heart (CTR = 0.58) with decreased pulmonary vascularity. Arterial blood gases revealed hypoxemia (PO2 24.1 mmHg) and metabolic acidosis, even though the patient was receiving O2 at 50%. The two-dimensional echocardiogram from the parasternal long axis view showed an echo-dense tumor mass in the right ventricular cavity. At autopsy, a complex congenital heart disease was found. The pathologic findings were: patent ductus arteriosus (1.0 x 0.5 cm), fenestrated foramen ovale, unopening pulmonary valve with thrombus (0.3 x 0.2 cm), right ventricular hypoplasia and hypertrophy of the right ventricular wall (1 cm in thickness). A ball like, organized and calcified thrombus, measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm was found in the right ventricular cavity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Central cyanosis and clubbing in an 18-year-old postpartum woman presenting with a stroke. An 18-year-old woman without previously documented medical history delivered a healthy 32-week-old preterm infant. Severe bleeding occurred during week 1 postpartum secondary to ruptured vaginal condylomas. The consequent anemia was accompanied by complaints of exercise intolerance that resolved with blood transfusion. Six weeks later, the patient was brought to the emergency department of the regional medical center, where she was found to be unresponsive, with a left-sided hemiparesis and with hypoxemia that failed to correct with assisted ventilation and 100% oxygen. A cardiology consultation was obtained, which identified the patient as having central cyanosis and heretofore unappreciated marked clubbing of fingers and toes. This suggested a diagnosis of right-to-left shunting, likely at the cardiac level, together with presumptive embolic stroke, which was documented by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography as a left pontine infarct. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified anomalous drainage of the inferior vena cava into the left atrium, which was confirmed by a three-dimensional computed tomographic angiogram. Corrective surgery in the form of atrial septostomy and redirection of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium was performed. The patient was subsequently discharged and is in stable condition 3 months later without effort intolerance and with normal arterial oxygen saturation on room air.

Echocardiographic diagnosis and transcatheter occlusion of pulmonary arteriovenous fistula in cyanotic newborn. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare cause of cyanosis in newborn. A 12-day-old male newborn (2.8 kg) was referred to our hospital with the complaints of cyanosis and respiratory distress. On two-dimensional echocardiography, the right pulmonary artery (PA) appeared larger than left PA and the left atrium, left ventricle were dilated. The right heart chambers were in normal limits. A color flow Doppler echocardiogram revealed a turbulent flow due to a PAVM originating from medium branch of right PA, and continuous wave Doppler showed continuous flow pattern. Agitated saline injection resulted in the delayed appearance of the contrast in the left-side chambers three to four heart cycles after appearance in the right-side chambers; the study was considered positive and indicative of an intrapulmonary shunt. Selective angiography of the right PA confirmed the diagnosis of a large solitary PAVM in the right middle lobe with a feeding artery. Amplatzer vascular plug I, which is designed to close abnormal vascular structures, was chosen to close the PAVM. The deployment of device performed safely and the oxygen saturation of baby increased to 95% immediately after deployment. Heart failure and respiratory distress also resolved after the procedure.

The chest roentgenogram showed an abnormal right-heart border, and the echocardiogram demonstrated enlargement of the left ventricle and left atrium. Cardiac catheterization and angiography demonstrated a right pulmonary artery to left atrium communication. The infant responded favorably to medical management and is asymptomatic with the exception of mild cyanosis with crying. Right pulmonary artery to left atrium communication is a rare but potentially correctable cause of cyanosis in the newborn.


Anesthetic management for cesarean section in a patient with uncorrected double-outlet right ventricle. We describe the anesthetic management for cesarean section in a pregnant woman with uncorrected double-outlet right ventricle. The anesthetic method, treatment of complications and lessons are discussed. A 28-year-old woman visited our emergency room for progressive dyspnea and recurrent hemoptysis at 30Â weeks' gestation. Her New York Heart Association functional class was III-IV. Echocardiography indicated that she had congenital heart disease of double-outlet right ventricle. She hadn't received any treatment. The obstetrician decided to terminate the pregnancy by cesarean section. We chose epidural anesthesia and pumped phenylephrine at the same time to minimize hemodynamic fluctuation. Just in the process of changing position to supine position with uterus displaced to the left, the patient coughed badly and complained about dyspnea. At the same time, the oxygen saturation decreased quickly. The symptoms were ameliorated soon by treating as heart failure. But the symptoms reappeared after oxytocin administration. At the end of surgery, the baby was sent to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for premature birth. The mother recovered successfully and discharged 7Â days later. Double-outlet right ventricleÂ is a seldom disease and pregnancy with uncorrectedÂ double-outlet right ventricleÂ is rare.Â In this case, the patient belonged to the type of ventricular septal defect characterized by subaortic ventricular septal defect without pulmonary stenosis.Â Most of the aorta arises from the right ventricle, the volume of venous blood was injected from the right ventricle into the aorta, which decided the oxygen saturations.Â Compared to general anesthesia, epidural anesthesia reduces venous return and alleviates the cardiac burden.Â So, we pumped phenylephrine along with epidural anesthesia in case of critical cyanosis following significant blood pressure decrease. In the process of anesthesia, dyspnea, cough and cyanosis attacked the patient for two times. The most probable reason was heart failure which induced by the sudden increasing of returned blood. As a result of severe cough, pulmonary artery pressure increased rapidly. Then a great amount ofÂ venous blood was injected into the aorta and cyanosis became more serious as well as oxygen saturation declined quickly. Epidural anesthesia with continuous phenylephrine infusion is a preferable choice for parturient women with uncorrected double-outlet right ventricle for cesarean section. It is not the optimal choice for this type of patients to lie on the left. The dose of oxytocin should be reduced to avoid potential cardiovascular complications.


[Right ventricular thrombus mimicking a tumor mass in a newborn with pulmonary atresia--an autopsy report]. Intracardiac masses in infancy are not common. Tumors, thrombi and vegetations of bacterial endocarditis are exceedingly rare in this age group. These masses are seldom diagnosed before the infant's death. Two-dimensional echocardiography is a noninvasive technique that can detect and differentiate intracardiac masses that occur in infants. It can serially detect changes in the size or location of the masses, thus guiding subsequent medical or surgical intervention. An 11-day-old male newborn had suffered from lip and finger nail cyanosis, and dyspnea since 2 days old. Physical examination revealed subcostal retractions and no heart murmur during admission but a grade II/VI systolic murmur with a sometime grade II/VI continuous murmur which could be heard at the left upper sternal border 3 days after admission. The liver was palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. The electrocardiogram was normal. The chest X-ray showed a normal sized heart (CTR = 0.58) with decreased pulmonary vascularity. Arterial blood gases revealed hypoxemia (PO2 24.1 mmHg) and metabolic acidosis, even though the patient was receiving O2 at 50%. The two-dimensional echocardiogram from the parasternal long axis view showed an echo-dense tumor mass in the right ventricular cavity. At autopsy, a complex congenital heart disease was found. The pathologic findings were: patent ductus arteriosus (1.0 x 0.5 cm), fenestrated foramen ovale, unopening pulmonary valve with thrombus (0.3 x 0.2 cm), right ventricular hypoplasia and hypertrophy of the right ventricular wall (1 cm in thickness). A ball like, organized and calcified thrombus, measuring 2.0 x 1.3 x 1.0 cm was found in the right ventricular cavity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)




Question:
One day after doctors helped a 28-year-old primigravid woman deliver a 4700 g (10 lb 6 oz) boy, he has bluish discoloration of his lips and fingernails. Oxygen saturation on room air is 81%. Examination shows central cyanosis. A continuous machine-like murmur is heard over the left upper sternal border. A single S2 heart sound is present. Supplemental oxygen does not improve the cyanosis. Echocardiography shows the pulmonary artery arising from the posterior left ventricle and the aorta arising from the right ventricle with active blood flow between the right and left ventricles. Further evaluation of the mother is most likely to show which of the following?

[A] : Elevated fasting blood glucose
[B] : Positive rapid plasma reagin test
[C] : Prenatal alcohol use
[D] : Prenatal phenytoin intake

[A case of secondary pulmonary cryptococcosis complicating diabetes mellitus]. In this case, a 65-year-old man complained of fever and productive cough while being treated for diabetes mellitus at the outpatient clinic. His chest CT scan revealed multiple infiltrative lesions in both the right and left lower pulmonary lobes. He was therefore given an antibiotic on suspicion of having bacterial pneumonia, and he also received nutritional instruction in relation to diabetes mellitus, and remission resulted. However, he could not maintain sufficient glycemic control thereafter, and his pulmonary lesions persisted. Because his lesions changed into cavitied multiple nodular lesions, as seen on a chest CT scan, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen demonstrated Cryptococcus organisms, and the Cryptococcus antigen titer was high, which led to a diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis. After oral treatment with fluconazole for 1 year and 4 months, only a small nodule in the right lower lobe and a funicular lesion in the left lower lobe remained on a chest CT scan, and the patient had neither subjective symptoms nor evidence of inflammation, although he still had a positive antigen titer for Cryptococcus. Thus, the treatment was terminated. Improvement of the clinical symptoms and of the laboratory and radiological findings demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment.

Spontaneous Hemoptysis in a Patient With COVID-19. A 65-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, gradually worsening for the previous 2Â weeks, associated with dry cough, sore throat, and diarrhea. He denied fever, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any sick contacts or travel history outside of Michigan. His medical history included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, morbid obesity, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and tobacco use. He was taking amiodarone, carvedilol, furosemide, pregabalin, and insulin. The patient appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. He was afebrile and had saturation at 93%Â on 3Â L of oxygen, heart rate of 105 beats/min, BP of 145/99Â mmÂ Hg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. On auscultation, there were crackles on bilateral lung bases and chronic bilateral leg swelling with hyperpigmented changes. His WBC count was 6.0 K/cumm (3.5 to 10.6 K/cumm) with absolute lymphocyte count 0.7 K/cumm (1.0 to 3.8 K/cumm); serum creatinine was 2.81Â mg/dL (0.7 to 1.3Â mg/dL). He had elevated inflammatory markers (serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and creatinine phosphokinase). Chest radiography showed bilateral pulmonary opacities that were suggestive of multifocal pneumonia (Fig 1). Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Therapy was started with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine, and methylprednisolone 1Â mg/kg IV for 3Â days. By day 3 of hospitalization, he required endotracheal intubation, vasopressor support, and continuous renal replacement. Blood cultures were negative; respiratory cultures revealed only normal oral flora, so antibiotic therapy was discontinued. On day 10, WBC count increased to 28 K/cumm, and chest radiography showed persistent bilateral opacities with left lower lobe consolidation. Repeat respiratory cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa (TableÂ 1). Antibiotic therapy with IV meropenem was started. His condition steadily improved; eventually by day 20, he was off vasopressors and was extubated. However, on day 23, he experienced significant hemoptysis that required reintubation and vasopressor support.

Context:
Risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension in Italy. To identify factors related to poor control of blood pressure in primary care, we designed a retrospective case-control analysis of clinical and demographic data recorded in the General Practitioners (GP) database. Study data were provided on a voluntary basis by 21 GPs from a practice-based network in primary care. The study included 2519 hypertensive patients enrolled between January 1 and December 31, 2000. The interventions were antihypertensive medication, and the main outcome measures were control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). The independent variables considered were: age of patient and GP; patient gender, body mass index, history of smoking, diabetes mellitus, or cholesterol tests; family history of hypertension; previous visits for cardiologic, nephrologic, or vascular surgery evaluation; prior hospitalizations for myocardial infarction or heart failure, and number of admissions for surgery; length of patient follow-up, type of antihypertensive medication, mean daily dosage, adherence to the drug regimen, and number of other medications currently being taken by the patient. Blood pressure was uncontrolled (&gt;140/90 mmHg) in 1525 (60%) of the 2519 hypertensive patients enrolled. The presence of diabetes mellitus, increasing patient age, and increasing GP age significantly increased the risk of uncontrolled BP. Factors significantly associated with a reduced risk of uncontrolled BP were the number of other medications currently being taken by the patient and a prior history of MI. We conclude that the failure of antihypertensive medication to adequately control BP is determined by both the patient's characteristics and factors related to the patient-doctor relationship. Successful treatment of hypertension requires patient adherence to the regimen that has been agreed on by the patient and the physician.

On primary survey, he was dyspnoeic with a room air saturation of 85% and a blood pressure of 80/50 mmâHg. A bedside ultrasound revealed an ejection fraction of around 40%, with hypokinesia of interventricular septum, left ventricular apex and anterior wall with bilateral multiple B lines in all lung zones. A 12 lead ECG showed ST segment elevation in leads V2-V6. He sustained a cardiac arrest. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved following high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After successful resuscitation, the patient underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention and recovered fully from the event. On further evaluation, an acute binge of marijuana smoking prior to the onset of symptoms was identified as the cause of the acute coronary syndrome.

Silent broken heart (Can shortness of breath be the only presentation of myocardial infarction?). A 55-year-old previously healthy man was referred to our cardiology outpatient department (by the respiratory team) due to shortness of breath that started 2-3 months prior. He suddenly became breathless after changing a car wheel with no other associated symptoms. Specifically, he denied ever having had chest pain. His breathlessness got gradually worse preventing him from performing simple everyday activities, such as climbing stairs, and a couple of weeks before presentation, the patient noticed ankle oedema. He was an ex-smoker and drank 3-4 units of alcohol daily. There was a family history of hypertension. He worked as a contract manager in the construction industry. After clinical examination, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and the patient was admitted for further investigations. Clinical examination and investigation confirmed missed myocardial infarction with a complication of ventricular aneurysm. The patient was referred to cardiothoracic surgeons for surgical correction of the defect.

Hypertension in the elderly. To study the clinical profile of hypertension in the elderly, development of end organ complications and the effect of hypertension with other risk factors in producing these complications. One hundred and thirty six elderly patients attending the Hypertension Clinic were included in the study. A detailed history was taken that included presenting illness, family history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, dyslipidaemia and history of addictions. Physical examination included systemic examination with measurement of waist to hip ratio and fundoscopy for retinopathy. Renal and liver function tests (RFT, LFT), blood sugar, lipid profile, X-ray chest, electrocardiography (ECG), 2-D echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan head (if indicated) were other important investigations done. Seventy-nine patients were in the age group of 60-65 years, of which 42 (30.9%) were males. Headache was the commonest chief complaint in 77.9% patients; whereas 24 patients were asymptomatic. Obesity, diabetes, alcohol, dyslipidaemia and family history were important determinants of hypertension. Lipid profile was abnormal in 55.9% patients. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) was found in 56.6% patients. Grade II hypertensive retinopathy was observed in 29.4% patients with uncontrolled blood pressure. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was the commonest ECG manifestation seen in 36.8% patients of which 26.5% had uncontrolled blood pressure. LVH could be diagnosed in 46.4% patients by 2-D echo. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure and ISH had increased incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Cardiovascular complications were seen in 19.1% patients having dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Cerebrovascular complications were seen in 15.4% patients having hypertension with LVH. Treatment included calcium channel blockers and/or other drugs. The elderly hypertensive patients tend to have ISH. Family history of hypertension is an important determinant of hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension, ISH, LVH and other associated risk factors are responsible for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity.

Sudden infant deaths from undiagnosed ventricular septal defect - Report of two autopsy cases. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) has a relatively non-aggressive clinical course; either spontaneous closure or causing congestive heart failure treatable with surgical intervention. We present two autopsy cases of sudden infant deaths from clinically undiagnosed VSDs. Case 1 was an 18-day-old boy. As the deceased coughed and became limp after feeding, he was carried to a hospital. Heart murmur was not auscultated there, so he was brought back to home. He presented severe dyspnea and then he was pronounced dead the next day. Case 2 was a 3-week-old boy. Any abnormality was pointed out at physical examination, although his mother felt his wheeze. He developed respiratory arrest at home in the morning and then he was confirmed dead at the hospital. Heart weights of these babies were heavier than mean weights of each normal development. There were perimembranous VSDs in both cases. Histology revealed that the pulmonary arterial walls were thickened. We diagnosed the cause of death in these cases was cardiac collapse with pulmonary hypertension due to VSD. Congenital heart diseases can be diagnosed as early as before birth, because echocardiograph and fetal echography are prevalent in these days. Most VSDs can be noticed by systolic murmur even today. We consider that the failure of initial clinical diagnosis of VSD in primary physical assessment could lead unexpected sudden death. These two cases reminded us to the importance of auscultation which is conventional but as one of the indispensable measure to find a clue for the congenital abnormality.

Noncompaction-like membranous structure in left ventricle. A 22-day-old boy born to a 21-year-old gravida 1, para 1 mother was admitted to our hospital for routine newborn examination. On physical examination, any clinical abnormality or malformations were not observed except 1/6 systolic murmur. A well-demarcated membranous structure was confirmed by echocardiography which was starting from left ventricular apex, extending to the mitral chords including papillary muscles in apical four-chamber and parasternal long-axis examination. This structure was considered as a variant of left ventricular noncompaction. The patient is still being followed up in our pediatric cardiology department.

[Accurate assessment of heart murmurs in children: thorough medical history and physical examination required]. 4 children, boys aged 12, 5, 1.5 and 11 years, had a heart murmur. The 12-year-old boy could also not finish a football match and appeared to have atrioseptal defects (ASD). The 1.5-year-old boy had pulmonary symptoms that were not responsive to asthma medication; he also had ASD. The 11-year-old boy had had chest pain and pressure following exertion for 2 years; he appeared to have an aortic stenosis. Symptoms disappeared in all 3 patients after surgical correction. In the 5-year-old asymptomatic boy the murmur was deemed to be innocent following medical history and physical examination. Children frequently have heart murmurs. Most heart murmurs are innocent but some are caused by heart defects. Careful evaluation of the medical history and physical examination are critical in the differentiation of innocent and pathological heart murmurs. Routine supplementary diagnostic tests in children with heart murmurs are of limited value and are often misleading. One should inquire about specific and nonspecific symptoms and also perform systematic inspection, palpation and auscultation to identify any characteristics that suggest a heart murmur caused by a heart defect.

The patient has no history of cyanosis or heart failure; however, a holosystolic, harsh murmur was noted at the 3- and 6-month check-ups. On examination, the patient is playful and alert. He has met all developmental milestones. The cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with persistence of the holosystolic, harsh murmur. What is the most likely cause of the murmur in this child?

[A] : Defect of muscular interventricular septum
[B] : Defect of the membranous interventricular septum
[C] : Defective dynein functioning
[D] : Failure of endocardial cushion to form

Context:
Evaluation and management of heart murmurs in children. Heart murmurs are common in healthy infants, children, and adolescents. Although most are not pathologic, a murmur may be the sole manifestation of serious heart disease. Historical elements that suggest pathology include family history of sudden cardiac death or congenital heart disease, in utero exposure to certain medications or alcohol, maternal diabetes mellitus, history of rheumatic fever or Kawasaki disease, and certain genetic disorders. Physical examination should focus on vital signs; age-appropriate exercise capacity; respiratory or gastrointestinal manifestations of congestive heart failure; and a thorough cardiovascular examination, including features of the murmur, assessment of peripheral perfusion, and auscultation over the heart valves. Red flags that increase the likelihood of a pathologic murmur include a holosystolic or diastolic murmur, grade 3 or higher murmur, harsh quality, an abnormal S2, maximal murmur intensity at the upper left sternal border, a systolic click, or increased intensity when the patient stands. Electrocardiography and chest radiography rarely assist in the diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is recommended for patients with any other abnormal physical examination findings, a history of conditions that increase the likelihood of structural heart disease, symptoms suggesting underlying cardiac disease, or when a specific innocent murmur cannot be identified by the family physician. Echocardiography provides a definitive diagnosis and is recommended for evaluation of any potentially pathologic murmur, and for evaluation of neonatal heart murmurs because these are more likely to be manifestations of structural heart disease.

Context:
Clues in diagnosing congenital heart disease. A number of practical office and bedside clues to cardiac disease in infants and children have been passed on through the years. They relate to the history, to the inspection and palpation components of the physical examination, and to knowledge of the specific cardiac defects that are likely to be associated with certain clinical syndromes. With the possible exception of coarctation of the aorta, the clues are not diagnostically specific. In many instances, however, they serve to narrow a broad array of diagnostic possibilities to 2 or 3 and, with the aid of other clues and auscultation, they can often be distinguished from one another. When a primary care physician is confronted with a child who has an incidental murmur that is "probably" innocent but could be organic, useful clues favoring an organic murmur are a history of congenital heart disease in a first-degree relative; a history of maternal rubella syndrome, alcohol use, or teratogenic drug use during pregnancy; a history of inappropriate sweating; a history of syncope, chest pain, or squatting; maternal diabetes mellitus; premature birth; birth at a high altitude; cyanosis; abnormal pulsations; recurrent bronchiolitis or pneumonia; chronic unexplained hoarseness; asymmetric facies with crying; and a physical appearance suggestive of a clinical syndrome.

Sudden infant deaths from undiagnosed ventricular septal defect - Report of two autopsy cases. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) has a relatively non-aggressive clinical course; either spontaneous closure or causing congestive heart failure treatable with surgical intervention. We present two autopsy cases of sudden infant deaths from clinically undiagnosed VSDs. Case 1 was an 18-day-old boy. As the deceased coughed and became limp after feeding, he was carried to a hospital. Heart murmur was not auscultated there, so he was brought back to home. He presented severe dyspnea and then he was pronounced dead the next day. Case 2 was a 3-week-old boy. Any abnormality was pointed out at physical examination, although his mother felt his wheeze. He developed respiratory arrest at home in the morning and then he was confirmed dead at the hospital. Heart weights of these babies were heavier than mean weights of each normal development. There were perimembranous VSDs in both cases. Histology revealed that the pulmonary arterial walls were thickened. We diagnosed the cause of death in these cases was cardiac collapse with pulmonary hypertension due to VSD. Congenital heart diseases can be diagnosed as early as before birth, because echocardiograph and fetal echography are prevalent in these days. Most VSDs can be noticed by systolic murmur even today. We consider that the failure of initial clinical diagnosis of VSD in primary physical assessment could lead unexpected sudden death. These two cases reminded us to the importance of auscultation which is conventional but as one of the indispensable measure to find a clue for the congenital abnormality.


Noncompaction-like membranous structure in left ventricle. A 22-day-old boy born to a 21-year-old gravida 1, para 1 mother was admitted to our hospital for routine newborn examination. On physical examination, any clinical abnormality or malformations were not observed except 1/6 systolic murmur. A well-demarcated membranous structure was confirmed by echocardiography which was starting from left ventricular apex, extending to the mitral chords including papillary muscles in apical four-chamber and parasternal long-axis examination. This structure was considered as a variant of left ventricular noncompaction. The patient is still being followed up in our pediatric cardiology department.

[Accurate assessment of heart murmurs in children: thorough medical history and physical examination required]. 4 children, boys aged 12, 5, 1.5 and 11 years, had a heart murmur. The 12-year-old boy could also not finish a football match and appeared to have atrioseptal defects (ASD). The 1.5-year-old boy had pulmonary symptoms that were not responsive to asthma medication; he also had ASD. The 11-year-old boy had had chest pain and pressure following exertion for 2 years; he appeared to have an aortic stenosis. Symptoms disappeared in all 3 patients after surgical correction. In the 5-year-old asymptomatic boy the murmur was deemed to be innocent following medical history and physical examination. Children frequently have heart murmurs. Most heart murmurs are innocent but some are caused by heart defects. Careful evaluation of the medical history and physical examination are critical in the differentiation of innocent and pathological heart murmurs. Routine supplementary diagnostic tests in children with heart murmurs are of limited value and are often misleading. One should inquire about specific and nonspecific symptoms and also perform systematic inspection, palpation and auscultation to identify any characteristics that suggest a heart murmur caused by a heart defect.
