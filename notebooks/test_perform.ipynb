      "[B]. Cholesterol embolization, also known as atheroembolism, can occur after vascular procedures like cardiac catheterization. It is characterized by the deposition of cholesterol crystals in the small vessels, leading to ischemia and inflammation. The intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles seen on the renal biopsy are consistent with cholesterol crystals, and the patient's recent cardiac catheterization makes this a likely cause.\n",
      "\n",

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a small-to-medium vessel vasculitis associated with asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis. While the patient does have eosinophilia, the absence of respiratory symptoms and the specific biopsy findings make this less likely.\n",

      "[C]. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand.
