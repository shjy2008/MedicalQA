      "Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that can also lower blood pressure and reduce heart rate, but it is not typically the first choice in the setting of ACS due to its potential to cause coronary artery dilation, which could theoretically worsen ischemia in the setting of cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm.\n",

      "[C]. Past medical history of breast cancer - There is no direct contraindication for the use of a copper IUD in women with a history of breast cancer.
