2025-10-02 19:40:10,883 - INFO - [question_and_options:]A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?

[A] : Ampicillin
[B] : Ceftriaxone
[C] : Doxycycline
[D] : Nitrofurantoin
2025-10-02 19:40:17,096 - INFO - [rag_doc:]0:[Acute cystourethritis during pregnancy]. A prospective study was carried out in 103/863 obstetric patients with cystitis characterized by urinary urgency and frequency, dysuria, pyuria and suprapubic discomfort in the absence of systemic symptoms such as fever and costovertebral angle tenderness. The association of symptomatic lower urinary tract infection with low-count bacteriuria (10(2)-10(5) UFC/mL of urine) was present in all the patients. The incidence of cystourethritis was about 12%, most of the infections occurred at the first trimester. To learn whether a multiple-dose of nitrofurantoin or ampicillin is safe and effective therapy for acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections, 103 symptomatic pregnant women were randomly grouped to receive oral nitrofurantoin (100 mg t.i.d.) or ampicillin (500 mg t.i.d.) for five days. Seventeen patient were excluded since they did not return for follow-up. Escherichia coli was isolated in 67% of infections. Overall cure varied from 87% to 89%, without any great differences between the regimens. Nine patients had asymptomatic bacteriuria in the course of pregnancy, four developed acute pyelonephritis and one of them had abnormal intravenous pyelogram.

2025-10-02 19:40:17,096 - INFO - [rag_doc:]1:A randomized trial of three antibiotic regimens for the treatment of pyelonephritis in pregnancy. To compare the effectiveness of three antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy. One hundred seventy-nine pregnant women earlier than 24 weeks' gestation who had acute pyelonephritis were randomized to 1) intravenous (i.v.) ampicillin and gentamicin, 2) i.v. cefazolin, or 3) intramuscular ceftriaxone. All participants then completed 10-day courses of oral cephalexin after primary treatment. A urine culture was performed on admission and 5-14 days after completion of therapy. Surveillance for persistent or recurrent infection and obstetric complications continued until delivery. On the basis of a two-sided hypothesis test and with alpha = .025, 60 subjects were needed in each group for statistical power greater than 80% to detect a difference between ceftriaxone and other antibiotics if hospital length of stay differed by 1 or more days. The treatment groups were similar in age, parity, temperature, gestational age, and initial white blood cell count. There were no statistically significant differences in length of hospitalization, hours until becoming afebrile, days until resolution of costovertebral angle tenderness, or infecting organism. There were no statistically significant differences in birth outcomes between the three groups. The average (standard deviation) age at delivery was 38.8 +/- 3.6 weeks. The average birth weight was 3274 +/- 523 g. Eleven (6.9%) of 159 subjects delivered prematurely. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen isolated (137 of 179, 76.5%). Blood cultures were positive for organisms in 15 cases (8.4%). At follow-up examination within 2 weeks of initial therapy, eight (5.0%) of 159 subjects had urine cultures positive for organisms. Ten women (6.3%) had cultures positive for organisms later in their antepartum course, and 10 other participants (6.3%) developed recurrent pyelonephritis. There are no significant differences in clinical response to antimicrobial therapy or birth outcomes among subjects treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, cefazolin, or ceftriaxone for acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation.

2025-10-02 19:40:17,096 - INFO - [rag_doc:]2:Successful treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium pyelonephritis with daptomycin during pregnancy. To report successful treatment using daptomycin for pyelonephritis associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) in a 27-week pregnant woman. A 20-year-old 27-week pregnant patient with a history of spina bifida, neurogenic bladder, and multiple hospitalizations for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) was diagnosed with pyelonephritis. She was treated with daptomycin 260 mg (4 mg/kg) daily for 14 days on the basis of a urine culture that revealed E. faecium resistant to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, and vancomycin. All cultures following treatment revealed no growth, and the patient as well as the neonate displayed no adverse effects. VRE UTIs can be treated safely in pregnancy with nitrofurantoin, if the organism is susceptible. Other viable options in the treatment of VRE, including linezolid, doxycycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, have lower urinary concentrations, teratogenic risk, or limited findings regarding their safety in pregnancy. Daptomycin was selected in this case due to its efficacy in the treatment of VRE, high urinary concentrations, pregnancy category B, and one case report indicating its successful use in pregnancy. Treatment of VRE in pregnancy can be challenging due to the teratogenicity or unknown safety of available options. The use of daptomycin in our patient enabled a successful outcome of multidrug-resistant E. faecium in a complicated pregnant patient without observed neonatal abnormalities.

Symptoms started 2Â weeks before presentation, with minimal productive cough and dyspnea on exertion. One week after the initial symptoms, the patient started noticing right-sided chest and shoulder pain along with subjective fevers and night sweats. She denied hemoptysis, weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, or rash. Her pregnancy had so far been uncomplicated. The patient did not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs. She worked at a daycare center but denied any particular sick contacts. She moved to the United States 7 years ago from Sudan and denied any recent travel.

A 20-year-old woman, G2P1, presented to the labor and delivery triage with right flank pain and emesis of sudden onset without any precipitating factors. The patient denied history of trauma, anticoagulant therapy, or hypertension. At the time of admission, the patient was in severe pain, was afebrile, had a blood pressure of 139/79, and heart rate of 96. Abdominal exam revealed no tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound. Musculoskeletal tenderness was elicited from infra-scapular region to the sacroiliac joint on the right side. Mild right costovertebral tenderness was noted. Her cervix was dilated 3cm, effaced 50 percent, with fetal station at -3, unchanged from previous visit. Fetal monitor tracing was reassuring and obstetric ultrasonogram at 22 weeks showed normal fetal anatomy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed T2 hyperintense signal involving and surrounding the right adrenal gland suggesting infarct.

2025-10-02 19:40:17,096 - INFO - [expected_output:]The clinical scenario suggests that the pregnant woman is likely experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI), given her symptoms of burning upon urination. During pregnancy, the risk of UTIs increases due to physiological changes, and it is important to treat them to prevent complications such as pyelonephritis or preterm labor.

When considering antibiotic therapy for a UTI in a pregnant woman, it's crucial to choose an agent that is safe for both the mother and the fetus. Let's evaluate the options:

[A]. Ampicillin - This is a penicillin antibiotic that is generally considered safe during pregnancy and can be used to treat UTIs. However, it may not be the first choice due to resistance patterns.

[B]. Ceftriaxone - This is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is also generally safe in pregnancy and effective against a broad range of bacteria. It is typically used for more complicated infections or when other antibiotics are not suitable.

[C]. Doxycycline - This is a tetracycline antibiotic that is contraindicated during pregnancy because it can affect fetal bone growth and discoloration of teeth.

[D]. Nitrofurantoin - This antibiotic is commonly used to treat uncomplicated UTIs and is considered safe during most of the pregnancy. However, it is not recommended at the very end of pregnancy (after 38 weeks) due to the risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn.

Given that the patient is at 22 weeks gestation and has an uncomplicated UTI, the best choice would be an antibiotic that is safe and commonly used for UTIs in pregnancy.

So, the answer is [D]. Nitrofurantoin.

2025-10-02 19:40:17,096 - INFO - [question_and_options:]A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation?

[A] : Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud
[B] : Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize
[C] : Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus
[D] : Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
2025-10-02 19:40:22,084 - INFO - [rag_doc:]0:The embryologic origin of ventral body wall defects. Ventral body wall defects include ectopia cordis, bladder exstrophy, and the abdominal wall malformations gastroschisis and omphalocele. The etiology of ectopia cordis, gastroschisis, and bladder exstrophy is not known, but they may be linked to abnormalities in the lateral body wall folds responsible for closing the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic portions of the ventral body wall. These folds form in the fourth week (postfertilization) of development as a combination of the parietal layer of lateral plate mesoderm and overlying ectoderm and must move ventrally to meet in the midline. There are differential rates of cell proliferation in the folds and asymmetries in their movement that may be involved in teratogenic effects of toxic factors. Also, the fusion process between the folds is complex, involving cell-to-cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell reorganization and all of these phenomena may be targets for disruption, leading to malformations. In this regard, closure of the ventral body wall is likened to neural tube closure and involves similar processes. It also encompasses a similar time frame during development, such that most neural tube and ventral body wall defects have their origins during the fourth week of development. Omphalocele is a separate entity whose etiology is known. This defect is attributed to a failure of gut loops to return to the body cavity after their normal physiological herniation into the umbilical cord from the 6th to 10th week of development. Thus, the origin of this defect is completely different from that of the ventral body wall malformations.

Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated that she has frequent (&gt;6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming and crying lasting up to 1 hour since her birth. These episodes increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within 1 hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking, hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes. Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks, daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in the first year. Occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking and a paternal history of sleeping walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily schedule. Sleep deprivation, differences parent child-rearing practices, social isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30 minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician.

His abdomen was grossly distended but soft and nontender. A trial of nasogastric feeds resulted in a worsening of his clinical status. He was transferred to the ICU, and diagnostic imaging was concerning for a distal bowel obstruction. Surgical pathology revealed a surprising diagnosis, which is described in detail in the following case.

The boy's mother says he has been less active and more irritable since the onset of the rash, and that he is hardly eating. She also tells you that earlier in the day, her son told her that it hurts to walk. A complete review of systems is otherwise negative. The 5-year-old was born at term without complication. He has met all developmental milestones and his immunizations are up to date. He takes no medications. The boy's vital signs are normal. He has an erythematous maculopapular rash distributed on his legs symmetrically; it is palpable, nontender, and nonblanching. You detect no abnormalities in abdominal, neurologic, or musculoskeletal examinations. A complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) reveal mild leukocytosis with a normal differential. Urinalysis shows moderate blood and trace protein. Laboratory results are otherwise normal. What's your diagnosis?

2025-10-02 19:40:22,085 - INFO - [expected_output:]The infant's presentation with fussiness, regurgitation of feeds, and yellow-colored vomit is suggestive of a gastrointestinal issue that is likely related to an embryologic development error. Let's analyze each of the provided options:

[A]. Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud - This can lead to conditions such as annular pancreas, where the pancreas forms a ring around the duodenum and can cause duodenal obstruction. This would present with symptoms similar to what is described, including vomiting, which can be yellow if it contains bile.

[B]. Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize - This would cause duodenal atresia, which presents with bilious vomiting within the first few days of life. While the vomit described is yellow (suggestive of bile), the timing and presentation don't align perfectly with duodenal atresia, as the symptoms would have likely appeared earlier than 3 weeks of age.

[C]. Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus - This would lead to pyloric stenosis, which typically presents with projectile non-bilious vomiting in infants around 2 to 8 weeks of age. However, the vomit in this case is described as yellow, which suggests the presence of bile, making pyloric stenosis less likely since the obstruction in pyloric stenosis is before the bile enters the digestive tract.

[D]. Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline - This is related to congenital abdominal wall defects such as gastroschisis or omphalocele. These conditions would be noticeable at birth due to visible defects in the abdominal wall and are not consistent with the symptoms described.

Given the description of yellow vomit, which indicates the presence of bile and therefore an obstruction distal to where bile is introduced into the digestive tract, the most likely embryologic error is an abnormal migration of the ventral pancreatic bud leading to an annular pancreas and subsequent duodenal obstruction.

So, the answer is [A].

Chest CT revealed emphysematous change and honeycombing in the lung and bilateral subpleural opacifications. Cardiac ultrasound examination showed pulmonary hypertension. Treatments with antibiotics, corticosteroids and heparin were unsuccessful. Despite mechanical ventilation, she died of respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed that intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma had spread via the hematogeneous route, formed multiple emboli into the pulmonary small arteries, and led to severe pulmonary hypertension and lung infarction.

We report an autopsy case of a 60-year-old Japanese woman who died 27 years after the onset of systemic sclerosis and 4 years after the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Oral administration of bosentan was effective in improving her dyspnea but had to be stopped because of drug eruption along with fever and eosinophilia. During hospitalization for the treatment of multiple skin ulcers and gangrene, she suddenly complained of severe respiratory difficulty, followed by bradycardia, unconsciousness and cardiopulmonary arrest. The autopsy revealed concentric intimal proliferation and marked luminal obstruction in many small- and medium-sized vessels of the lungs. In addition to right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation, similar vascular changes were also present in the myocardial tissue and the atrioventricular node. In our patient, these marked vascular changes caused pulmonary hypertension followed by the severe right heart failure. The vascular changes in the atrioventricular node were suspected as the cause of a fatal arrhythmia leading to sudden death.

We report a rare case of sudden death of a patient with acute pulmonary thromboembolism associated with chlorine gas poisoning. A 21-year-old man in a water-filtration plant accidentally inhaled highly concentrated chlorine gas. He was immediately brought to a hospital after exposure. On admission, the patient had clouding of consciousness, dyspnea, and deep cyanosis. Arterial blood gas values indicated severe hypoxemia; PaO2 was 35.9 mmHg and PaCO2 was 42.4 mmHg. The clinical course was uneventful and he was satisfactorily recovering. However, ten days after admission he became sick and markedly cyanotic. He lost consciousness and then he went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Despite efforts at resuscitation, he died. An autopsy revealed bilateral pulmonary thromboembolism, although he apparently did not have any risk factor for embolism. The toxicity of chlorine gas may be related to the pulmonary thromboembolism, but the mechanisms leading to his death are unclear.

2025-10-02 19:40:27,300 - INFO - [rag_doc:]4:Case report of 2 sudden deaths after surgery for bone fracture: Usefulness of immunohistochemical analysis of coronary artery for identifying acute myocardial infarction. Death following orthopedic surgery has become rare, but does occur. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can be a cause of such death, but diagnosis of AMI is often challenging, even by autopsy. We have recently experienced 2 cases of sudden death after bone fracture surgery, in which AMI and pulmonary thromboembolism were clinically suspected as causes of death. Case 1 was a 60-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus who died 7 days after surgery for Lisfranc dislocation fracture. Case 2 was a 75-year-old female who died several hours after surgery for proximal femur fracture. At autopsy, slight myocardial change suggestive of AMI, severe coronary stenosis, and pulmonary congestion were noted in case 1. No signs for AMI were observed, but diffuse fat emboli were identified in the pulmonary vasculature in Case 2. Thus, postmortem pathological diagnosis was AMI in case 1 and it was suggestive of fat emboli in case 2. Immunohistochemical analysis of smooth muscle markers in the coronary artery was performed in both cases. The positivity ratio of h-caldesmon to Î±-smooth muscle actin indicative of maturity of neointimal smooth muscle cells was preserved in case 2 but diminished in case 1, where coronary occlusion may have been caused via plaque rupture. Immunostaining of smooth muscle markers in the coronary artery may serve as a supporting tool in establishing or disregarding AMI at autopsy.

2025-10-02 19:40:27,300 - INFO - [expected_output:]The clinical history of the patient includes a recent surgery (fractured femur) and a period of immobility during recovery at a rehab facility. The sudden onset of shortness of breath followed by cardiac arrest is highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, which is a common complication post-surgery due to thrombus formation during periods of immobility.

Histological examination of the lung tissue showing fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is indicative of an organized thrombus. Over time, a thrombus can become organized and recanalized, leading to the presence of fibrous connective tissue as the body attempts to restore patency to the vessel.

Pulmonary ischemia (B) is a condition that results from insufficient blood flow to the lung tissue, but it does not typically cause fibrous connective tissue formation around the pulmonary artery.

Pulmonary hypertension (C) is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which can lead to remodeling of the vessel walls, but the acute presentation in this case is not typical of pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary passive congestion (D) is a condition that occurs due to left heart failure leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation. This can cause congestion and edema but would not typically cause the formation of fibrous connective tissue around the pulmonary artery.

Considering the patient's history and the histological findings, the most likely pathogenesis for the observed lung changes is thromboembolism, which occurs when a blood clot that has formed elsewhere in the body (often in the deep veins of the legs, known as deep vein thrombosis) breaks loose and travels to the lungs, causing a blockage.

So, the answer is [A].

Separately, von Willebrand disease and menorrhagia are two relatively common conditions; in combination they occur at a prevalence of approximately 11-16%. Such patients exhibit a reduced quality of life and can incur a relatively high rate of gynecologic interventions; for example dilatation and curettage, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. Initial evaluation involves a focused history for the following bleeding symptoms: menorrhagia since menarche, easy bruising of greater than 5 cm 1-2 times/month, frequent gum bleeding when flossing or brushing teeth or epistaxis 1-2 times/month. In addition, for those who have already undergone invasive interventions with the subsequent risk for hemorrhage, inquiry should be made regarding excessive bleeding with childbirth, dental tooth extraction and/or surgery. Step-wise testing includes a complete blood cell count and an assessment of the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, iron profile, serum creatinine and thyroid-stimulating hormone level, followed by Factor VIII level, von Willebrand factor antigen and ristocetin cofactor, followed by consideration of platelet aggregation studies. Additional hemostatic studies may include obtaining a Factor XI level and euglobulin clot lysis time. Intuitively, failure to diagnose an underlying hemostatic disorder may lead to continued menorrhagia and diminished quality of life, as well as unnecessary surgical interventions that may in turn be fraught with an increased risk of bleeding. The management of von Willebrand disease-related menorrhagia involves consideration of the patient's age, childbearing status and preference. In the adolescent, surgical intervention is not an option, whereas an older patient beyond her childbearing years may choose a hysterectomy as a definitive treatment in lieu of continued medical therapy with intranasal/subcutaneous 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), oral antifibrinolytic agents or oral contraceptive. The sexually active patient may initially choose a trial of oral contraceptive or the levonorgestrel intrauterine device, Mirena((R)). Pending ongoing comparative trials in von Willebrand disease-related menorrhagia of intranasal DDAVP, tranexamic acid and the levonorgestrel intrauterine device, specific recommendations cannot be made at present regarding the superiority of one intervention compared with another. It should also be noted that the dose and schedule of intranasal DDAVP, tranexamic acid and epsilon-amino caproic acid have not been well established and warrant further study in combination and at various doses and schedules.

The evaluation of the woman with abnormal bleeding, particularly menorrhagia, carries a relatively high yield of discovering an underlying disorder of hemostasis. The most common underlying hemostatic disorder would be von Willebrand disease, with an estimated prevalence of 7% to 20%. In addition, preliminary results suggest that another 20% to 30% of patients may have impaired platelet aggregation as another cause of menorrhagia. Disorders of fibrinolysis may be an additional underlying hemostatic disorder. Initial intake should include documentation of menorrhagia by the pictorial chart assessment of menstrual flow. Baseline characteristics of menstrual flow should also be documented including the frequency of changing the sanitary napkin on the heaviest day, use of more than one sanitary napkin at a time, and number of days lost from school or work. Menorrhagia since menarche, a history of surgicalor dental-related bleeding, and a history of postpartum hemorrhage are items of the bleeding symptom audit that appear to predict in part von Willebrand disease in women with menorrhagia. Epistaxis and easy bruising do not appear to be clearly discriminatory symptoms. Initial testing should include the complete blood cell count, protime, activated partial thromboplastin time, iron profile, serum creatinine, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, factor VIII level, von Willebrand factor antigen, ristocetin cofactor, and platelet aggregation studies. Additional hemostatic studies may also include a factor XI level and euglobulin clot lysis time. Intuitively, failure to diagnose an underlying hemostatic disorder may lead to continued menorrhagia and diminished quality of life, as well as unnecessary surgical interventions, which, in turn, may be fraught with increased bleeding.

2025-10-02 19:40:35,668 - INFO - [rag_doc:]2:Acquired von Willebrand's syndrome causing a hemorrhagic diathesis in a patient with hypothyroidism. The occurrence of bleeding diathesis with menorrhagia and easy bruising may occur in patients with moderate to severe hypothyroidism sometimes linked to acquired von Willebrand's disease (VWD). We describe a patient with profound hypothyroidism in whom the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was established while evaluating uncontrolled gingival bleeding after a dental procedure. Thyroid hormone replacement led to a rise in von Willebrand factor, factor VIIIC, and a significant fall in the elevated bleeding time from 15 to 8 min. Acquired von Willebrand's disease is an unusual manifestation of hypothyroidism and is reversible.

2025-10-02 19:40:35,668 - INFO - [rag_doc:]3:Menorrhagia from a haematologist's point of view. Part I: initial evaluation. The evaluation of menorrhagia should no longer be solely the task of the gynaecologist. In women with ovulatory bleeding (regular cycles), the prevalence of von Willebrand disease (vWD) in about 15% of these, as well as disorders of platelet function and fibrinolysis causing menorrhagia, warrants an active role by the haematologist. Initial intake should include documentation of menorrhagia by the pictorial chart assessment of menstrual flow. Baseline characteristics of menstrual flow should also be documented, including the frequency of changing the sanitary pad on the heaviest day, use of more than one sanitary pad at a time, number of days lost from school/work and the impact of menses on various quality-of-life parameters. Menorrhagia since menarche, a past history of surgical- and/or dental-related bleeding and a past history of postpartum haemorrhage are items of the bleeding symptom audit that appear in part to predict vWD in women with menorrhagia. Epistaxis and easy bruising do not appear to be clearly discriminatory symptoms. Initial testing should include the complete blood cell count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, iron profile, serum creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone level, factor VIII level, vWF antigen, ristocetin cofactor and platelet aggregation studies. Additional haemostatic studies may also include a factor XI level and euglobulin clot lysis time. This extensive medical evaluation should assure both the patient and the gynaecologist that the possibility of an underlying haemostatic disorder has been thoroughly investigated, to avoid the patient undergoing further costly procedures and surgical interventions if an underlying haemostatic disorder remains unrecognized.

2025-10-02 19:40:35,668 - INFO - [rag_doc:]4:Frequency of inherited bleeding disorders in women with menorrhagia. Although menorrhagia is a common gynaecological symptom, a specific cause is identified in less than 50% of affected women. We investigated the frequency of inherited bleeding disorders in women with menorrhagia. Women referred for investigation of menorrhagia whose pelvis was normal on clinical examination and who had an estimated menstrual blood loss of more than 80 mL were studied. A detailed menstrual history and history about other bleeding symptoms was taken. The activated partial thromboplastin time, factor VIII activity, von-Willebrand-factor antigen and activity, and factor XI (FXI) were measured in all patients; further tests were done when results were at or outside the limits of the assays. 150 women were screened. An inherited bleeding disorder was diagnosed in 26 (17%) patients: the disorders were von Willebrand's disease of mild (15) or moderate severity (three), mild FXI deficiency (four), mild von Willebrand's disease and FXI deficiency (one), combined von Willebrand's disease, FXI deficiency, and factor X deficiency (one), carriage of haemophilia-A gene (one), and platelet dysfunction (one). The frequency of von Willebrand's disease and FXI deficiency were 13% (95% CI 7.9-18.8%) and 4% (1.5-8.5%), respectively. Menorrhagia since menarche was noted in 11 (8.9%) of 123 women without a bleeding disorder compared with 13 (65%) of 20 women with von Willebrand's disease (p=0.001) and four (66.7%) of six women with FXI deficiency (p&lt;0.001). Inherited bleeding disorders are found in a substantial proportion of women with menorrhagia and a normal pelvis examination. We suggest that such patients should be investigated for these disorders-especially von Willebrand's disease-before invasive procedures are done.

2025-10-02 19:40:35,668 - INFO - [expected_output:]The patient presents with a history of menorrhagia and easy bruising, which are common symptoms of a bleeding disorder. Given that the patient's mother also had similar symptoms, there is a suggestion of a hereditary bleeding disorder.

The laboratory results show a normal platelet count and prothrombin time (PT), but a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). PT evaluates the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways, whereas PTT evaluates the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways.

[A]. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects males predominantly and results in a deficiency of factor VIII. This condition would result in a prolonged PTT but is less likely in a female patient unless she is a carrier manifesting symptoms due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation.

[B]. Lupus anticoagulant is an antiphospholipid antibody that interferes with phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests, causing a prolonged PTT in vitro. However, it is associated with thrombosis rather than bleeding and does not explain the hereditary pattern seen in this patient.

[C]. Protein C deficiency is a condition that increases the risk of thrombosis and does not typically cause a bleeding tendency. It would not be expected to cause a prolonged PTT.

[D]. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and affects both males and females. It is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is important for platelet adhesion and protection of factor VIII. VWD can cause menorrhagia and easy bruising and is associated with a prolonged PTT due to the role of VWF in stabilizing factor VIII.

Given the clinical presentation of menorrhagia, easy bruising, a family history of similar symptoms, and the laboratory findings of a prolonged PTT with normal PT and platelet count, von Willebrand disease is the most likely diagnosis.

So, the answer is [D].

2025-10-02 19:40:45,381 - INFO - [rag_doc:]0:Soft tissue case 61. A 55-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of severe crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and obstipation. The patient had a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, lupus, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, pancreatitis and renal calculi. However, the patient had no history of a hernia or abdominal surgery. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 38.5 degrees C and a soft distended abdomen that was diffusely tender without signs of peritonitis. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Routine laboratory investigations including a complete blood cell count, electrolytes, liver enzymes and amylase were normal, with the exception of a decreased hemoglobin level of 116 g/L. We ordered a plain abdominal radiograph (Fig. 1) and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen. What is your diagnosis?

2025-10-02 19:40:45,381 - INFO - [rag_doc:]1:Portal Vein Thrombosis and Intra-Abdominal Hypertension Presenting as Complications of Hypertriglyceridemia-Induced Severe Acute Pancreatitis. A 44-year-old male without any significant past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with the chief complaint of severe constant epigastric pain for three hours. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended and tender, particularly in the epigastric region. The lab work showed an elevation of the lipase (12,405 U/L) and triglycerides (5,837 mg/dL). An abdominal CT scan with contrast was ordered, which revealed non-necrotic pancreatitis. In addition, the liver ultrasound showed no evidence of gallstones. Subsequently, fluid infusion, meropenem, pain medication, and an insulin drip were started, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). After six hours in the ICU, he complained of abdominal pain despite taking a high hydromorphone dose. On further physical examination, the abdomen was tender and distended but without rebound tenderness. The gastric distention on kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB) and a bladder pressure of 34 mmHg raised the suspicion for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), which led us to place a nasogastric tube (NGT) and consult the surgical team. The patient's symptoms and bladder pressure were closely followed and showed significant improvement. On day seven in the ICU, the patient responded well to medications; feeding through the Dobhoff tube was started, and his triglycerides decreased to approximately 1,000 mg/dL. Despite his general improvement and meropenem regimen, the patient spiked a fever of 38.5 Â°C. Due to the possibility of pancreatitis complications, a CT abdomen with contrast was ordered, which showed partial portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Subsequently, enoxaparin was started, and the patient was closely observed for gastrointestinal bleeding. Eventually, after 17 days in the ICU, the patient was transferred to the floor andÂ then discharged from the hospital with normal lab tests and without evidence of portal thrombosis on abdominal CT. In this report, we illustrate and discuss a case of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced pancreatitis (HTGP), which progressed to PVT and IAH. Physicians should be aware that patients with HTG are inclined to have severe pancreatitis. In addition, the degree of triglyceride elevation is correlated with the severity of acute pancreatitis.

2025-10-02 19:40:45,381 - INFO - [rag_doc:]2:An interesting cause of collapse in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. A 55-year-old man attended the emergency department following an episode of collapse. He was known to have chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst. He had recently been recumbent due to chronic abdominal pain. On arrival he was unwell. Baseline observations revealed an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air, pulse 115 bpm and blood pressure 86/57 mm Hg. Physical examination was unremarkable except for mild abdominal tenderness. He was started on high-flow oxygen, intravenous fluid and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A chest x-ray was unremarkable. Massive pulmonary embolus was considered a likely diagnosis. The patient underwent an urgent CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). As this was undertaken as an urgent investigation straight from the resuscitation area a d-dimer test was not performed. The CTPA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but demonstrated a subdiaphragmatic collection. An arterial phase abdominal CT scan was thus performed, which confirmed a large subcapsular splenic haematoma and splenic vein thrombosis. The patient was resuscitated with blood products and transferred for splenic artery embolisation.

A 30-year-old male with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever, two days of intermittent abdominal pain, dry cough, nausea, vomiting, four days of diarrhea, and worsening dyspnea. Initial evaluation revealed a fever of (102.5 F) and tachycardia (114/min) with hypoxia (SaO2: 84% on room air) and bilateral wheezing on lung auscultation. X-ray of the chest revealed bilateral and peripheral ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities. CT scan of the abdomen was notable for interstitial edema, mild inflammatory changes, and homogenous enhancement of the pancreatic parenchyma. His COVID-19 test came positive, and he was admitted to the intensive-care unit. He was managed symptomatically, and improvement in his clinical condition was observed after three days of admission. This case highlights a possible association between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), abdominal pain secondary to acute pancreatitis, and the need for meticulous clinical evaluation in patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints.

2025-10-02 19:40:45,381 - INFO - [rag_doc:]4:CONVERSION OF HYPOTHYROIDISM TO HYPERTHYROIDISM: A RARE CLINICAL PHENOMENON. We present a patient with long standing hypothyroidism who developed hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease. Recognition of this disease phenomenon is crucial to ensure prompt diagnosis and close follow-up. The patient was evaluated with thyroid function testing and thyroid antibody testing. Further evaluation included ophthalmologic examination and radioactive iodine uptake imaging. A 56-year-old female with past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C infection, and hypothyroidism presented for evaluation of thyroid disease. She had been off of levothyroxine for the last 8 months due to biochemical findings of thyrotoxicosis. Her family history was significant for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Laboratory tests were consistent with hypothyroidism so levothyroxine was restarted. Physical exam showed lid lag and proptosis. Ophthalmologic evaluation found bilateral 23 mm proptosis. Additional lab testing was positive for thyroid peroxidase antibody and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin. Following levothyroxine use, the patient developed subclinical hyperthyroidism and thyroid replacement was stopped. The patient remained euthyroid for 1 year off of levothyroxine. Following 1 year, she developed mild hyperthyroidism with increased radioactive iodine uptake. She was placed on propranolol for symptomatic relief. Months later, thyroid function testing normalized. In Graves disease, hypothyroidism and conversion of hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism are rare, yet important to recognize, clinical phenomenon. The stimulatory and inhibitory properties of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies are speculated to play a role in individuals with alternating hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. These individuals can present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Clinicians must maintain a high clinical suspicion for this disease entity.

2025-10-02 19:40:45,381 - INFO - [expected_output:]The patient presents with severe abdominal pain radiating to her back, nausea, and an abdominal CT consistent with acute pancreatitis. The notable aspect of her history is a recent scorpion sting. While aspirin, oral contraceptive pills, and hypothyroidism can have various impacts on health, they are not typically associated with acute pancreatitis in the context presented. 

Scorpion stings, particularly from certain species, can lead to pancreatitis due to the toxins present in the venom, which can cause a systemic inflammatory response and direct toxic effects on the pancreas. Given the timing of the onset of symptoms following the scorpion sting and the lack of a more typical cause for pancreatitis in this patient's history and presentation, the scorpion sting is the most likely etiology.

So, the answer is [C].

2025-10-02 19:40:55,434 - INFO - [rag_doc:]0:Remote prognosis of preeclampsia in women 25 years old and younger. Twenty-six primiparous women less than or equal to 25 years old who delivered between 1963 and 1978 and met the following criteria were studied: (1) The first obstetric visit was at less than or equal to 30 weeks' gestation with diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 85 mm Hg; (2) diastolic blood pressure before delivery was greater than or equal to 95-mm Hg, rising at least 15 mm Hg; (3) 24-hour urine protein measured at least 1.0 gm; and (4) patients were enrolled in the Kaiser Health Plan in 1982. Each of the 26 patients was paired with a primiparous woman by year delivered, age, race (black versus nonblack), and weight +/- 1/3. In 23 pairs blood pressure follow-up was available in 1980 or thereafter, which was at least 3 1/2 years after delivery (average interval between delivery and follow-up = 10 years). Three in the preeclampsia group and two in the matched control group had hypertension, with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Mean systolic blood pressure (123.7 mm Hg) was 9.3 mm Hg higher in the preeclampsia group than in the matched controls (114.4 mm Hg), with a standard error of 4.15 mm Hg (p = 0.04). Mean diastolic blood pressure (77.0 mm Hg) was 2.9 mm Hg higher in the preeclampsia group than in the controls (74.1 mm Hg), with a standard error of 3.0 mm Hg (p = 0.345). We conclude that no significant difference in frequency of hypertension or diastolic blood pressure and a small but significant difference in systolic blood pressure is shown in follow-up between patients with preeclampsia and matched controls.

2025-10-02 19:40:55,434 - INFO - [rag_doc:]1:Hemodynamic analysis of cephalothoracopagus by the color doppler method. A comparison to normal fetuses via a longitudinal study. In a case of cephalothoracopagus, the umbilical artery (UA) was observed with color Doppler method, and the findings were compared with the hemodynamics of 46 normal fetuses. The patient was a 25-year-old primigravida who had appeared for routine prenatal visits since her 6th week of pregnancy. At a later time, the patient was examined after an interval of 4 weeks. Although an ultrasonography was also conducted, unfortunately, any findings of cephalothoracopagus were not detected. In the 25th week of gestation, we hospitalized her for marked polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index: 280 mm), at which time an ultrasound examination revealed cephalothoracopagus. In the UA, the V(max) was 30.3 cm/s (normal fetus at 25-28 weeks: 33.5 +/- 3.9 cm/s). The UA hemodynamics fell below the normal range. At 26 weeks, the UA V(max) was 56.5 cm/sec, a level which significantly exceeded the normal range. The patient underwent a cesarean section at 27 weeks of gestation; the indication was fetal distress. This is caused by the condition in which the fetal heart beats decreases to 90 beats per minute 3 times during a 10-min period as measured on the cardiotocograms. She delivered a 1,392-gram female with an Apgar score of 2 points (respiratory 1 point and heart rate 1 point). The infant was a cephalothoracopagus, with one head, two hearts, four upper limbs, and four lower limbs. The neonate died from circulatory failure 56 min after birth.

After an unremarkable course of her pregnancy a 26-year-old woman was admitted in the 32nd week because of her poor general condition with nausea, vomiting and headache. Her blood pressure was 220/140 mmHg and the pulse irregular with a rate of about 90/min. The urine was markedly positive for glucose and protein, the cardiotachogram was unremarkable. Antihypertensive treatment was started because pre-eclampsia was suspected. At first the patient's condition improved, but a few hours after admission an emergency section had to be performed for maternal and fetal indications, but the eutrophic male child was dead. Postoperatively the electrocardiogram and increased creatine kinase activity were suspicious of an acute myocardial infarction. Chest radiogram and echocardiography showed signs of marked ventricular dysfunction. Coronary angiography excluded coronary artery disease. The concentrations of catecholamine and its metabolites in 24-hour urine were greatly elevated above normal. Ultrasound and computed tomography demonstrated a tumour in the region of the left adrenal suggesting phaeochromocytoma, a diagnosis that was confirmed when the tumour was resected. Phaeochromocytoma is a rare cause of toxaemia of pregnancy and presents a high maternal and fetal risk. Its prognosis for both mother and child can be improved only if it is diagnosed and treated prenatally.

On physical examination the blood pressure in upper extremity was 155/95 and in lower extremity was 90/55âmmHg, and heart rate was 93âbeats/min. Transthoracic echocardiography showed narrowing of the descending aorta, the diameter of the aortic arch was 10.60âmm and an echocardiographic gradient was 96âmmHg. During the pregnancy (from 16 weeks to 38 weeks) BP was regulated with metoprolol. Cesarean section delivery was applied at 38 weeks of gestation. There was no complication in postpartum period. Spinal anesthesia application was used for caesarean section intervention and healthy female baby was delivered with the APGAR scores of 10/10. Herein the diagnosis of aortic coarctation is reviewed and the management when found during pregnancy is discussed.

A 39 year-old pregnant woman (with one healthy 11 year-old daughter) presented at the antenatal care clinic for routine non-stress test (NST) at the due date. The NST demonstrated normal fetal heart pattern. No anamnestic or clinical risk factors for diabetes during the course of pregnancy were noted in the case file. Ultrasound examinations up to 30 weeks of gestation had shown fetal growth appropriate for gestational age. Two days later, the NST was non-reacting with almost no heart rate variability, indicating an acute fetal risk. While the condition of the fetus was being further assessed by Doppler sonography, a fall in fetal heart rate prompted an emergency section for fetal bradycardia. The male newborn had marked macrosomia (birth weight 5180 g). The pH in umbilical artery blood of 6,77 indicated severe intrauterine hypoxia. Apgar score was 0/1/5. Absence of heart beat and of spontaneous breathing required resuscitation. Echocardiography revealed a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dysfunction of the right ventricle and hepatomegaly indicating diabetic fetal pathology. The placenta displayed typical signs of carbohydrate disorder. The maternal 75 g oral glucose tolerance test confirmed the suspicion of maternal diabetes (glucose values 96/210/215 mg/dl). During the next the day the infant developed multi-organ failure involving the liver and kidneys, myocardial infarction with pericardial effusion and myoclonic seizures. His condition improved slowly under measures to stabilize the circulation, substitution of clotting factors and anticonvulsive therapy. Mechanical ventilation had to be continued for 5 weeks. Examination at 4 months of age revealed marked neurological abnormalities. The mother was referred to a diabetes specialist for further management. Undiagnosed and therefore untreated severe gestational diabetes may have fatal consequences for the fetus. Expert committees of obstetricians and diabetes specialists have recommended blood glucose screening between 24 - 28 weeks of gestation of every pregnant woman as part of the routine prenatal care.

2025-10-02 19:40:55,434 - INFO - [expected_output:]The patient is presenting with new-onset hypertension (blood pressure of 148/90 mm Hg and 151/90 mm Hg on two separate occasions) and significant weight gain over a short period, which could be indicative of fluid retention. Additionally, she has 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremity. These findings are concerning for preeclampsia, which is a condition that can occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation and is characterized by new-onset hypertension and either proteinuria or other signs of end-organ dysfunction.

Preeclampsia is a serious condition that can have adverse effects on both the mother and the fetus. The diagnosis of preeclampsia is based on the presence of hypertension and proteinuria, typically defined as the excretion of 300 mg or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample. Therefore, the most appropriate test to confirm the probable condition of this patient would be a 24-hour urine protein to assess for proteinuria.

So, the answer is [D].
