On his initial presentation, he was found to have a Grade II splenic injury that was managed non operatively by the trauma service. Four days later, he returned to the ED when he developed severe abdominal pain after coughing and was found to have active extravasation from the splenic parenchyma with hemoperitoneum on CT angiography and a grossly positive FAST exam.

A small area of low-density shadows near the tail of the pancreas and multiple shadows of enlarged lymph nodes were identified around the porta hepatis and the pancreas, with a mildly increased metabolic activity. On the basis of the CT images the patient was diagnosed with pancreatitis. Radionuclide imaging showed the absence of the spleen from its normal position (following splenectomy), but abnormal phagocytosis of multiple red blood cells was observed in the abdomen, which was diagnosed as ectopic splenic autotransplantation (ESAT).
