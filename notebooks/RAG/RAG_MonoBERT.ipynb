The subtalar and particularly talonavicular joints are affected most frequently. The posterior tibial tendon has an important role in mid-foot stability. In RA patients, chronic inflammation of this tendon or talonavicular joint arthritis can results in posterior tibial tendon rupture. This leads to a collapsed talonavicular joint and forefoot instability, first with talonavicular and later Chopart's joint involvement. This shows as a planovalgus foot, with the forefoot in pronation and the heel in valgus deviation. In a 61-year-old RA patient, ruptures of the posterior tibial tendon due to rheumatoid inflammation occurred bilaterally, with subsequent deviation and instability of the forefoot. Arthrodesis with a medial column screw-Midfoot Fusion Bolt was carried out on the left foot and 4 months later on the right foot. At 7 months after the left and 4 months after the right foot surgery, the patient was free from pain, both feet were stable under loading and the forefoot was firm. The planovalgus deformity was corrected, as well as a valgus deviation of the great toe. Radiography showed a good position of the screws and complete healing of the medial foot joints.\"\n",

Right and left balance during human locomotion has been estimated by the distance between locations of the sequential right and left heel-strikes, or step width. During the stance phase of human locomotion one leg maintains medial-lateral balance for the progression. We focused our attention on this point, and medial-lateral balance during straight-ahead and circular walking was investigated by recording sole-floor reaction force from five anatomically discrete points of human sole; calcaneus, 1st, 3rd, 5th metatarsals and great toe. Forces from these points were recorded during straight walking and circular walking. Medial-lateral balance was obtained by subtracting force at 5th metatarsal from force at 1st metatarsal (x-axis vector). The foot takes off the floor from medial balance in most steps, although in some steps the foot takes off from lateral balance at slower walking speed at 2 km/h or 4 km/h, showing variable patterns of x-axis vector. At faster walking speed at 6 km/h or 8 km/h body weight shifted to 1st metatarsal before taking off the floor.

    "rag_32_1 = \"[Assessment of interaction between the left and right ventricles using pressure-volume loops in various heart diseases]. To assess the interaction and interdependence of left and right ventricular function, ECG-gated radionuclide angiocardiography was performed immediately after cardiac catheterization during right atrial pacing for 11 patients with old myocardial infarction (MI), two with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, one with aortic stenosis (AS), two with pulmonary infarction (PI), and one with neurocirculatory asthenia (NCA). Absolute left ventricular (LV) volume curves were obtained by the count-based method with attenuation factor corrections. Biventricular pressure and volume curves were digitized and synchronized to end-diastole, and pressure-volume (P-V) loops were constructed throughout a cardiac cycle. The stroke work index (SWI), the work index per min (WI/M) and the contractility index (CNTI) were calculated from the P-V loops. In a patient with NCA, LV end-diastolic volume decreased during rapid pacing, but no significant change in the LV end-systolic P-V relation was recognized. However, the entire right ventricular (RV) P-V loop was shifted toward the left during rapid pacing. In a patient with AS, the LV P-V loop was markedly enlarged and every parameter of LV function was much greater than that of the right ventricle due to increased LV afterload. The areas of RV P-V loops in two patients with PI were larger than those of other patients, because RV pressure was relatively high, and RV volume was increased. It is suggested that RV pressure and volume overloads prevail in patients with PI. In four MI patients with three vessel disease and having collateral circulation, the LV end-systolic P-V relationship was shifted toward the lower right, and every parameter (SWI, WI/M, CNTI) of LV function decreased by rapid pacing. Myocardial ischemia may be induced by rapid pacing stress, causing decreased LV contractility. It was concluded that the P-V loops obtained by RNA and catheterization are clinically useful for estimating the interaction and interdependence between right and left ventricular hemodynamics.\"\n",

The pressure volume loop (PV loop) was measured, both preoperatively and postoperatively (immediately and two months after the operation) by a Miller catheter and echocardiogram. The left ventricular stroke work (LVSW), left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) markedly increased immediately after the operation. LVSW and LVEDV further increased, whereas LVEDP decreased with improvements in diastolic compliance two months after the operation. It was likely that those change of LV function was a sum of simple ASD and MS both of which have similar but less significant characters than Lutembacher syndrome.\"\n",

Pressure-volume (PV) loop is of great value for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) function, but its clinical application has been limited by methodological complexity. A new system was developed to make accurate loop with simplified procedure, and was applied to clinical and interventional study. The system constitutes of a mobile gamma camera, a poly-amplifier and a data processor (GMS-550U, Toshiba Medical) installed in cardiac catheterization labo for simultaneous raw data handling and successive analysis. Since LV time activity curve (TAC) obtained by usual ECG gating is not fully reliable for a entire cardiac cycle, radionuclide data acquired in list mode was formatted forward and backward from ECG trigger together with analog data of LV pressure, ECG and PCG. PV loops were drawn in 10 patients (OMI, AP, MR, HCM) and 5 normals before and after infusion of angiotensin-II (AII), and Emax and LV work (systolic; SW, diastolic; DW, net; NW = SW - DW) were measured. Radionuclide ventriculography was safely performed with cardiac catheterization even in patients with congestive heart failure. Satisfactory PV loops were obtained by the advantage of simultaneous acquisition of RNV and analog data. Changes of ECG, PCG, volume, pressure and derived indices through one cardiac cycle were readily comparable each other. Peak LV pressure (mmHg) increased from 134 to 159 and then 182 by infusion of AII, but no change in heart rate was observed Emax was higher in normals and AP (mean 1.96 mmHg/ml/m2) than in OMI and MR (range of 0.85-1.36). SW increased in response to rise of LV pressure in all subjects. NW increased in normals and AP, but decreased in OMI and MR with relative increase in DW. In conclusion, this new system is feasible for repetitive studies under drug intervention, since it makes accurate PV loop under physiologic state, i.e. without pacing and volume overloading. Variable changes of SW, DW, and NW in response to afterloading were clarified, which may be useful for the evaluation of cardiac reserve in normal and diseased heart.\"\n",

    "rag_74_1 = \"Impact of different levels of weight loss on blood pressure in overweight and obese women. This study sought to determine the impact of different levels of weight loss on blood pressure in overweight/obese women. One hundred fifty-nine overweight/obese women (age 48.7 +/- 9.7, weight 101.3 +/- 18.7 kg, BMI 37.3 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2)) completed a six-month clinical weight loss program that included weekly nutrition, behavior, and exercise instruction. Participants consumed a very-low-energy diet (VLED) for 12 weeks. VLED was followed by four weeks of gradual reintroduction to solid foods. At week 16, participants received a diet to maintain weight or slightly reduce weight (&lt;0.5 lb/week) which they followed for the duration of the study. All lab and blood pressure assessments were performed at baseline and six months. Three groups were formed according to the proportion of weight loss after six months; Group 1 had &lt; 10% (n = 19), Group 2 had 10%-20% (n = 64), and Group 3 had &gt;20% (n = 76) weight loss. Differences in systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) were found in dose response fashion for weight loss at six months with 125 +/- 17 (&lt;10%), 119 +/- 13 (10%-20%), and 117 +/- 15 (&gt;20%; p = 0.005). Differences in diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) were also found in dose response fashion with 81 +/- 9 (&lt;10%), 77 +/- 9 (10%-20%), and 75 +/- 9 (20%; p = 0.003). These data indicate that increasing weight loss beyond 10% of initial body weight may provide added improvements in blood pressure compared to less than 10% weight loss in overweight or obese women.\"\n",
    "rag_74_2 = \"Use of sibutramine in obese mexican adolescents: a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing in both the United States and Mexico. The goal of this article was to assess the efficacy and safety of sibutramine in obese Mexican adolescents. This was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial of sibutramine QD. Male and female patients aged 14 to 18 years with sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age and sex &gt;85th percentile were eligible. The primary end points for the trial were the baseline versus end point absolute values for body weight, BMI, and percentage of the initial BMI (%BMI); secondary end points were waist circumference and percentage of the initial waist circumference (%waist). These were measured at days -15, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 of the study. Quality of life was assessed at the study start and end using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Both groups received individually tailored diet and exercise programs. Forty-six patients (age range, 14-18 years) with a BMI &gt;95th percentile for age were included (sibutramine group, n = 23 [14 females, 9 males]; placebo group, n = 23 [12 females, 11 males]). Twenty-one patients in the sibutramine group and 19 patients in the placebo group completed the 6-month trial. Using the intent-to-treat data, weight (mean [SD]) in the sibutramine group changed from 92.5 (14.6) kg to 85.7 (14.4) kg, for a net weight loss of 7.3 kg (95% CI 4.6-9.9), a waist circumference loss of 8.0 cm (95% CI, 4.7-11.3), and a % BMI loss of 9.2% (95% CI, 6.9-11.6). In the placebo group, weight changed from 98.9 (22.7) kg to 94.6 (22.5) kg, a weight loss of 4.3 kg (95% CI, 1.7-6.9), a waist circumference loss of 3.8 cm (95% CI, 0.7-7.0), and a %BMI loss of 5.2% (95% CI, 2.4-7.9) (P &lt; 0.05 for all intragroup comparisons; P &gt; 0.05 for the intergroup comparisons). Mean (SD) scores on the SF-36 scale in the sibutramine group changed from 78.0 (13.3) at baseline to 84.8 (7.4) at study end (P &lt; 0.05); the respective values in the placebo group were 82.8 (10.3) and 87.3 (7.6) (P &lt; 0.05). At base-line, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 116.7 (5.9) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 118.3 (7.6) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective SBPs were 112.4 (9.6) mm Hg and 112.6 (6.5) mm Hg. At baseline, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 78.9 (4.5) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 79.5 (5.2) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective DBPs were 73.5 (6.3) mm Hg and 76.6 (6.2) mm Hg. At baseline, heart rate was 76.3 (6.4) beats/min in the sibutramine group and 81.1 (9.5) beats/min in the placebo group; at end point, the respective findings were 79.8 (8.8) beats/min and 77.6 (8.6) beats/min (P &gt; 0.05 for all preceding intergroup comparisons). One patient in the sibutramine group had increased blood pressure (at month 3) and 3 had increased heart rate (at months 1, 2, and 4); 2 patients receiving placebo had increased blood pressure (month 3) and 2 had increased heart rate (at months 1 and 3). These changes disappeared in 1 week and did not require treatment or trial suspension. Additionally, in the sibutramine group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: headache, dry mouth, headache with nausea, and headache with weakness and paleness (P &gt; 0.05). In the placebo group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: 2 cases of headache, as well as 1 case of headache with somnolence and 1 case of headache with dry mouth (P &gt; 0.05). Sibutramine 10 mg QD in addition to diet and exercise was effective and generally well tolerated in this population of obese Mexican adolescents.\"\n",
    "rag_74_3 = \"Randomized clinical trials of weight reduction in nonhypertensive persons. Since 1987, four randomized controlled clinical trials with 872 nonhypertensive subjects have produced results on weight-reducing interventions, involving decreased caloric intake and/or increased expenditure, for effects on blood pressure (BP). The Hypertension Prevention Trial maintained a 3.5-kg net weight loss through 36 months with intake reduction alone. This program decreased BP by 2.4/1.8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) compared to controls, but both weight loss and blood pressure changes were smaller when combined with decreased sodium intake. A Stanford University trial achieved weight losses of 7.4 and 5.1 kg over 12 months with diet and exercise, respectively. Effects on clinic BP were in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 mm Hg and did not differ by intervention approach. The sole trial in children, conducted at University of Michigan, found similar weight loss (about 7 kg) and BP effects from limiting caloric intake over 20 weeks, regardless of inclusion of an exercise program; the latter did, however, result in greater reductions in percent body fat, heart rate, and serum insulin levels. The Primary Prevention of Hypertension trial tested a multifactor intervention including reductions in weight (mean, 2.7 kg), sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity. During a 5-year period, clinic BP was reduced by 2.0/1.9 mm Hg, and the incidence of hypertension, by 52%. It is concluded that weight loss, however achieved, lowers BP in overweight nonhypertensive persons, and probably can contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of hypertension. Whether there are independent effects additive to weight loss from increasing physical activity and reducing sodium intake remains unknown.\"\n",

A small area of low-density shadows near the tail of the pancreas and multiple shadows of enlarged lymph nodes were identified around the porta hepatis and the pancreas, with a mildly increased metabolic activity. On the basis of the CT images the patient was diagnosed with pancreatitis. Radionuclide imaging showed the absence of the spleen from its normal position (following splenectomy), but abnormal phagocytosis of multiple red blood cells was observed in the abdomen, which was diagnosed as ectopic splenic autotransplantation (ESAT).
