    "Document: Hyperuricemia and the metabolic syndrome in Hangzhou. The aim of this study was to investigate prevalences of hyperuricemia and the metabolic syndrome (MS) in the Hangzhou population, and the relationship between serum uric acid and the MS. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 4155 subjects (2614 men and 1541 women) aged 20-80 years, recruited through a health check program in Hangzhou, China. Biochemical and haematological parameters were measured by standard methods. The diagnosis of the MS is made when three or four of the following criteria are met: 1) body mess index (BMI) >or= 25; 2) systolic blood pressure >or= 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >or= 90 mmHg; 3) fasting triacyglycerol >or= 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)  0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL) in men and 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) in women; 4) fasting glucose >or= 6.1 mmol/L (109 mg/dL). Hyperuricemia is defined by cut-off values of > 420 mumol/L for men and > 360 mumol/L for women. Prevalences were 16.9% (N=702) for hyperuricemia and 8.4% (N=349) for the MS. Serum uric acid concentration was significantly higher in males than in females (p0.0001), and significantly higher in subjects with obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension compared with those without. In the partial correlation analysis, after controlling for gender, age and creatinine, serum uric acid concentration was significantly positively correlated with BMI (r=0.301, p0.0001), systolic blood pressure (r=0.151, p0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (r=0.168, p0.0001), total cholesterol (r=0.144, p0.0001) and triacyglycerol (r=0.234, p0.0001). Results suggest that increased serum uric acid concentration is associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic disorders such Relevant: \n",

    "[An unusual picture of insulinoma in type-2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity]. Marked hyperinsulinism was demonstrated in the course of an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) in a 63-year-old woman with severe obesity (height 1.59 m, body weight 123 kg, body-mass index 46.4 kg/m2). The diabetic metabolic state, first diagnosed 12 years ago, had been replaced by a low plasma glucose level: she often had attacks of ravenous hunger. A reducing diet of 800 kcal had not been tolerated. She had not had any syncopes. She had continually gained weight since puberty, but her weight had remained relatively constant for the past 5 years during which she had been treated with L-thyroxine for a diffuse goitre (stage II). In the course of an oGTT (75 g glucose) the basal insulin concentration (146 pmol/l) had risen to 1663 pmol/l at 30 min. The basal proinsulin level was 50 times normal (66 pmol/l vs. 1.418 pmol/l), while the initial plasma glucose level had fallen from 4.3 mmol/l to 3.8 mmol/l. Spiral computed tomography of the pancreas showed a 3 x 2.5 cm mass in the region of the tail of the pancreas. At laparoscopy a 4 cm tumor was palpated in the region of the pancreatic tail. Left resection of the pancreas was performed. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed an insulinoma. A repeat of oGTT 6 months postoperatively demonstrated a markedly diminished insulin level compared with the preoperative results, as well as a diabetic metabolic state. In case of dramatic improvement of diabetes mellitus in an obese patient without drug treatment or weight reduction an insulin-producing tumour should be considered in the differential diagnosis. There may be no typical hypoglycaemic symptoms because of insulin resistance associated with the obesity.\n",
