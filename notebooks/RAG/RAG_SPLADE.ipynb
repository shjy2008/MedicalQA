The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing in both the United States and Mexico. The goal of this article was to assess the efficacy and safety of sibutramine in obese Mexican adolescents. This was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial of sibutramine QD. Male and female patients aged 14 to 18 years with sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age and sex &gt;85th percentile were eligible. The primary end points for the trial were the baseline versus end point absolute values for body weight, BMI, and percentage of the initial BMI (%BMI); secondary end points were waist circumference and percentage of the initial waist circumference (%waist). These were measured at days -15, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 of the study. Quality of life was assessed at the study start and end using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Both groups received individually tailored diet and exercise programs. Forty-six patients (age range, 14-18 years) with a BMI &gt;95th percentile for age were included (sibutramine group, n = 23 [14 females, 9 males]; placebo group, n = 23 [12 females, 11 males]). Twenty-one patients in the sibutramine group and 19 patients in the placebo group completed the 6-month trial. Using the intent-to-treat data, weight (mean [SD]) in the sibutramine group changed from 92.5 (14.6) kg to 85.7 (14.4) kg, for a net weight loss of 7.3 kg (95% CI 4.6-9.9), a waist circumference loss of 8.0 cm (95% CI, 4.7-11.3), and a % BMI loss of 9.2% (95% CI, 6.9-11.6). In the placebo group, weight changed from 98.9 (22.7) kg to 94.6 (22.5) kg, a weight loss of 4.3 kg (95% CI, 1.7-6.9), a waist circumference loss of 3.8 cm (95% CI, 0.7-7.0), and a %BMI loss of 5.2% (95% CI, 2.4-7.9) (P &lt; 0.05 for all intragroup comparisons; P &gt; 0.05 for the intergroup comparisons). Mean (SD) scores on the SF-36 scale in the sibutramine group changed from 78.0 (13.3) at baseline to 84.8 (7.4) at study end (P &lt; 0.05); the respective values in the placebo group were 82.8 (10.3) and 87.3 (7.6) (P &lt; 0.05). At base-line, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 116.7 (5.9) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 118.3 (7.6) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective SBPs were 112.4 (9.6) mm Hg and 112.6 (6.5) mm Hg. At baseline, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 78.9 (4.5) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 79.5 (5.2) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective DBPs were 73.5 (6.3) mm Hg and 76.6 (6.2) mm Hg. At baseline, heart rate was 76.3 (6.4) beats/min in the sibutramine group and 81.1 (9.5) beats/min in the placebo group; at end point, the respective findings were 79.8 (8.8) beats/min and 77.6 (8.6) beats/min (P &gt; 0.05 for all preceding intergroup comparisons). One patient in the sibutramine group had increased blood pressure (at month 3) and 3 had increased heart rate (at months 1, 2, and 4); 2 patients receiving placebo had increased blood pressure (month 3) and 2 had increased heart rate (at months 1 and 3). These changes disappeared in 1 week and did not require treatment or trial suspension. Additionally, in the sibutramine group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: headache, dry mouth, headache with nausea, and headache with weakness and paleness (P &gt; 0.05). In the placebo group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: 2 cases of headache, as well as 1 case of headache with somnolence and 1 case of headache with dry mouth (P &gt; 0.05). Sibutramine 10 mg QD in addition to diet and exercise was effective and generally well tolerated in this population of obese Mexican adolescents.\"\n",
    "rag_74_3 = \"Randomized clinical trials of weight reduction in nonhypertensive persons. Since 1987, four randomized controlled clinical trials with 872 nonhypertensive subjects have produced results on weight-reducing interventions, involving decreased caloric intake and/or increased expenditure, for effects on blood pressure (BP). The Hypertension Prevention Trial maintained a 3.5-kg net weight loss through 36 months with intake reduction alone. This program decreased BP by 2.4/1.8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) compared to controls, but both weight loss and blood pressure changes were smaller when combined with decreased sodium intake. A Stanford University trial achieved weight losses of 7.4 and 5.1 kg over 12 months with diet and exercise, respectively. Effects on clinic BP were in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 mm Hg and did not differ by intervention approach. The sole trial in children, conducted at University of Michigan, found similar weight loss (about 7 kg) and BP effects from limiting caloric intake over 20 weeks, regardless of inclusion of an exercise program; the latter did, however, result in greater reductions in percent body fat, heart rate, and serum insulin levels. The Primary Prevention of Hypertension trial tested a multifactor intervention including reductions in weight (mean, 2.7 kg), sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity. During a 5-year period, clinic BP was reduced by 2.0/1.9 mm Hg, and the incidence of hypertension, by 52%. It is concluded that weight loss, however achieved, lowers BP in overweight nonhypertensive persons, and probably can contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of hypertension. Whether there are independent effects additive to weight loss from increasing physical activity and reducing sodium intake remains unknown.\"\n",

    "[Preventive treatment of primary dysmenorrhea with ibuprofen]. An open, prospective study, including 15 young women with primary dysmenorrhea was carried out to asses the prophylactic administration of Ibuprofen for the treatment of severe and disabling primary dysmenorrhea. The study lasted six months, representing a total of 90 cycles, the inclusion criteria were: 1) severe and disabling primary dysmenorrhea, 2) Failure with previous conventional treatments, 3) regular menstrual cycles, 4) without active sexual life, 5) voluntary participation. The treatment schedule included 400 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hours, starting 24 hours before the menstrual cycle during 4 days of menstruation for six consecutive cycles. The intensity of the pain was recorded every eight hours using a linear analogue scale from 0 to 10 where 0 was absence of pain and 10 was severe or disabling pain. Results showed that the mean of initial intensity of the menstrual cramp experienced in the cycle before the treatment (control) was 9.47 +/- 0.5. During the prophylactic treatment the means of initial intensity of the pain were significantly lower, between 7.84 +/- 0.37 and 7.21 +/- 0.52. A statistically significant progressive decrease of pain was recorded during the duration of treatment. After 48 hours of treatment the intensity of the pain was recorded as three (mild). We conclude that the prophylactic administration of ibuprofen is an effective treatment for selected women experiencing severe and disabling primary dysmenorrhea.\n",

    "Increased vaginal bleeding and psychological distress: a longitudinal study of their relationship in the community. To explore the temporal relationship between the development of self-reported symptoms of vaginal bleeding and the development of psychological distress among women in the community. Prospective cohort study using postal surveys at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. An urban four-partner general practice with 10000 registered patients. All women aged 18-54 years on the practice age-sex register. Baseline postal questionnaire with follow up questionnaires sent at 6 and 12 months. The associations between the development of heavy periods and psychological distress. Two thousand and four hundred and thirty-five baseline questionnaires were sent out with an initial response rate of 76%. One thousand and five hundred and thirteen women (62%) responded to all three questionnaires. Women with psychological distress at baseline were more likely to develop heavy periods 6 months later than women without distress (adjusted odds ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.15, 3.02). Women with heavy periods at baseline were no more likely to develop psychological distress 6 months later than women with non-heavy periods (adjusted odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.73, 1.63). Similar findings existed with respect to intermenstrual bleeding and postcoital bleeding. Results of the 12-month analysis were similar. In the community, psychological distress appears to influence the future self-reporting of heavy periods and other symptoms of vaginal bleeding.\n",

    "STD interactive case challenge--diagnosing and treating chronic vulvar pain and erythema. A 36-year-old Caucasian woman arrives in your office, her chief complaint being vulvar pain and discomfort of 2 years' duration. She says that the onset of vulvar erythema and pain was gradual, beginning with mild tingling discomfort and eventually developing into dyspareunia and pain whenever she attempted to insert tampons, wore tight-fitting pants, or went horseback riding. The patient denies having vaginal discharge, change in menstrual pattern, or dysuria. She says she complained of the problem to several previous clinicians, who recommended anti-infective treatment for candidal vulvovaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, and recurrent cystitis, yet the symptoms persisted. One physician suggested a psychiatric evaluation, but the patient refused. She switched soap, shampoo, and even underwear fabric in an unsuccessful effort to ameliorate the symptoms. Over the past 6 months she has become increasingly frustrated with this problem.\n",

    "A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist’s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries.
