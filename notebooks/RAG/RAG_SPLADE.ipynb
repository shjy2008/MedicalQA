The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing in both the United States and Mexico. The goal of this article was to assess the efficacy and safety of sibutramine in obese Mexican adolescents. This was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial of sibutramine QD. Male and female patients aged 14 to 18 years with sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age and sex &gt;85th percentile were eligible. The primary end points for the trial were the baseline versus end point absolute values for body weight, BMI, and percentage of the initial BMI (%BMI); secondary end points were waist circumference and percentage of the initial waist circumference (%waist). These were measured at days -15, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 of the study. Quality of life was assessed at the study start and end using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Both groups received individually tailored diet and exercise programs. Forty-six patients (age range, 14-18 years) with a BMI &gt;95th percentile for age were included (sibutramine group, n = 23 [14 females, 9 males]; placebo group, n = 23 [12 females, 11 males]). Twenty-one patients in the sibutramine group and 19 patients in the placebo group completed the 6-month trial. Using the intent-to-treat data, weight (mean [SD]) in the sibutramine group changed from 92.5 (14.6) kg to 85.7 (14.4) kg, for a net weight loss of 7.3 kg (95% CI 4.6-9.9), a waist circumference loss of 8.0 cm (95% CI, 4.7-11.3), and a % BMI loss of 9.2% (95% CI, 6.9-11.6). In the placebo group, weight changed from 98.9 (22.7) kg to 94.6 (22.5) kg, a weight loss of 4.3 kg (95% CI, 1.7-6.9), a waist circumference loss of 3.8 cm (95% CI, 0.7-7.0), and a %BMI loss of 5.2% (95% CI, 2.4-7.9) (P &lt; 0.05 for all intragroup comparisons; P &gt; 0.05 for the intergroup comparisons). Mean (SD) scores on the SF-36 scale in the sibutramine group changed from 78.0 (13.3) at baseline to 84.8 (7.4) at study end (P &lt; 0.05); the respective values in the placebo group were 82.8 (10.3) and 87.3 (7.6) (P &lt; 0.05). At base-line, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 116.7 (5.9) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 118.3 (7.6) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective SBPs were 112.4 (9.6) mm Hg and 112.6 (6.5) mm Hg. At baseline, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 78.9 (4.5) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 79.5 (5.2) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective DBPs were 73.5 (6.3) mm Hg and 76.6 (6.2) mm Hg. At baseline, heart rate was 76.3 (6.4) beats/min in the sibutramine group and 81.1 (9.5) beats/min in the placebo group; at end point, the respective findings were 79.8 (8.8) beats/min and 77.6 (8.6) beats/min (P &gt; 0.05 for all preceding intergroup comparisons). One patient in the sibutramine group had increased blood pressure (at month 3) and 3 had increased heart rate (at months 1, 2, and 4); 2 patients receiving placebo had increased blood pressure (month 3) and 2 had increased heart rate (at months 1 and 3). These changes disappeared in 1 week and did not require treatment or trial suspension. Additionally, in the sibutramine group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: headache, dry mouth, headache with nausea, and headache with weakness and paleness (P &gt; 0.05). In the placebo group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: 2 cases of headache, as well as 1 case of headache with somnolence and 1 case of headache with dry mouth (P &gt; 0.05). Sibutramine 10 mg QD in addition to diet and exercise was effective and generally well tolerated in this population of obese Mexican adolescents.\"\n",
    "rag_74_3 = \"Randomized clinical trials of weight reduction in nonhypertensive persons. Since 1987, four randomized controlled clinical trials with 872 nonhypertensive subjects have produced results on weight-reducing interventions, involving decreased caloric intake and/or increased expenditure, for effects on blood pressure (BP). The Hypertension Prevention Trial maintained a 3.5-kg net weight loss through 36 months with intake reduction alone. This program decreased BP by 2.4/1.8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) compared to controls, but both weight loss and blood pressure changes were smaller when combined with decreased sodium intake. A Stanford University trial achieved weight losses of 7.4 and 5.1 kg over 12 months with diet and exercise, respectively. Effects on clinic BP were in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 mm Hg and did not differ by intervention approach. The sole trial in children, conducted at University of Michigan, found similar weight loss (about 7 kg) and BP effects from limiting caloric intake over 20 weeks, regardless of inclusion of an exercise program; the latter did, however, result in greater reductions in percent body fat, heart rate, and serum insulin levels. The Primary Prevention of Hypertension trial tested a multifactor intervention including reductions in weight (mean, 2.7 kg), sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity. During a 5-year period, clinic BP was reduced by 2.0/1.9 mm Hg, and the incidence of hypertension, by 52%. It is concluded that weight loss, however achieved, lowers BP in overweight nonhypertensive persons, and probably can contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of hypertension. Whether there are independent effects additive to weight loss from increasing physical activity and reducing sodium intake remains unknown.\"\n",

The clinical examination includes leg axis, position of the hind foot, deformity of the first ray as well as skin conditions, pulse status and possible sensitive deficits. AÂ shortening of the gastrocnemius muscle can be identified using the SilfverskiÃ¶ld test. Discomfort in the midfoot can indicate pathologies of the tarsometatarsal joint and the same applies for osteophyte infiltration around the Lisfranc joint line, whereby the second tarsometatarsal joint often shows more advanced degenerative arthritis than the first tarsometatarsal joint. Callosities under the second and third metatarsal heads correlate with aÂ faulty load transmission of the first ray. AÂ limitation of the range of movement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is usually associated with degenerative arthritis in Xâray imaging. Under weight bearing, Xârays of the foot in two planes represent the standard imaging examination. In addition to the intermetatarsal angle, the hallux valgus angle and the interphalangeal angle as well as the width of the first metatarsal bone influence the therapy decision. The same applies to degenerative changes or an obvious instability of the first tarsometatarsal joint. In many cases, initial signs of degenerative arthritis can be found in the metatarsophalangeal joint and around the sesamoid bones, although these often do not correlate to clinical symptoms.\n",

The foot is constituted from a series of small bones making a segmented structure with multiple joints, likened to a dome, in contact with the ground in three points: posteriorly the calcanear tuberosity; anteriorly and medially the head of 1st metatarsum, and anteriorly and laterally the head of 5th metatarsum. In fact, each foot presents a semi-arch whose base is represented by the lateral border and the summit by the medial border of the foot. The foot has been likened to a half-dome, so that when the medial borders of the two feet are placed together, a complete dome is formed. In the foot are present two longitudinal arches: the medial consists of the calcaneus, the talus, the navicular, the three cuneiform bones and the first three metatarsal bones. It is more arcuated and elastic then the lateral, that consist of the calcaneus, the cuboid and the 4th and 5th metatarsus. This is flattened and in contact with the ground. We can identify two transverse arches between longitudinal arches, extending from the medial to the lateral borders of the foot: the first is a lancet dome, between midfoot and forefoot, at the tarsometatarsal joint level; it consists of the bases of the metatarsal bones and the cuboid and the three cuneiform bones; the second is at flat dome, in correspondence of forefoot, at the metatarsophalangeal joint level; it consists of the bases of the proximal phalanges of the fingers and the head of five metatarsal bones. Longitudinal and transversal arches are supported from: the shape of stones of the structure (foot bones); the long and short plantar ligaments, larger and stronger than the dorsal ligaments, tie together the lower edges of the bones; a beam (the plantar aponeurosis and the plantar muscles and tendons) connecting the ends of the bridge effectively prevents separation of the pillars and consequent sagging of the arch; the maintenance of the arch depends on multiple support (ligaments, tendons of extrinsic muscles of the foot) suspending the arch from a cable above the level of the bridge. In this manner, we obtain a \"functional unit\" with two important aims: to support the body weight (static foot), and to serve as a lever to propel the bodies forward in walking and running (dinamic foot). Imaging techniques are able to provide further data on functional anatomy of the foot; in particular, these techniques show the bones structures, ligaments, muscles and tendons, taking part to the arch setting. Routine x-ray examinations precise information about the bone-shape and their relationship. The short and long ligaments, the tendons and the suspending the arch from above are instead successfully valuable using ultrasonography, CT and MR.\n",

      "Congenital subtalar dislocation--a case report. Congenital dislocation of the subtalar joint is one of the rarest forms of presentation of a calcaneo-valgus foot. We report the second case of this type published; an 18-month female child aged was seen with calcaneo-valgus deformity of left foot since birth. She was walking over the medial malleolus and medial border of foot. Radiographs and 3D CT scan of the left foot confirmed the diagnosis of a congenital subtalar dislocation. Surgical correction was achieved through a posterolateral incision, and the reduced joint was fixed with a k-wires for 6 weeks; the foot was immobilized in below knee cast for another 6 weeks, and an ankle foot orthosis was used for another 3 years. At 3 years post-surgical follow up, the child has a plantigrade foot with no functional impairment. Follow up radiographs and 3D CT scan confirmed the maintenance of well aligned talo-calcaneal joint. This type of dislocation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of calcaneo-valgus foot; a clear understanding of the pathology, a precise operative reduction, and long-term use of orthosis results in a favourable outcome.\n",

      "Medial arch orthosis for paediatric flatfoot. To evaluate any correlation between various foot angles and their respective American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores for pain, and the effectiveness of a medial arch orthosis. 81 children with bilateral symptomatic flatfoot were randomised into orthosis (n=55) and control (n=26) groups. The orthosis group consisted of 33 male and 22 female patients aged 36 to 204 (mean, 99) months and they were given a medial arch support. The control group consisted of 15 male and 11 female patients aged 36 to 192 (mean, 100) months and they were managed with analgesics. Foot angles including anteroposterior (AP) and lateral talocalcaneal (TC) angles, AP and lateral talo- first metatarsal (TFM) angles, calcaneal pitch angle (in lateral plane), and talonavicular (TN) angle were measured, as were AOFAS scores for pain for the forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot. After orthosis treatment, all AOFAS scores and all foot angles (except for the AP-TN angle) improved significantly. In the controls, all AOFAS scores (except for the midfoot score) and only the AP-TFM angle improved significantly. In the orthosis group, the AOFAS hindfoot score correlated positively with the lateral TC angle of the left foot (r=0.345, p=0.010) and negatively with the calcaneal pitch angle of the right foot (r=-0.33, p=0.015). In the control group, the lateral TFM angle of the left foot correlated negatively with the AOFAS forefoot (r=-0.566, p=0.003) and midfoot scores (r=-0.497, p=0.001), whereas the calcaneal pitch angle of the left foot correlated positively with the AOFAS forefoot score (r=0.497, p=0.010). Medial arch support orthosis significantly improved AOFAS scores and foot angles. Calcaneal pitch angle and lateral TC angle correlated well with AOFAS hindfoot scores.\n",

      "New Sagittal Plane Reference Parameters for Foot Deformity Correction Planning: The Vitruvian Foot. Currently available methods for analysis and planning of post-traumatic or congenital deformity correction of the foot have some limitations. The aim of this retrospective study was to establish reference lines and angles (RLAs), and the resulting ratios, based on reproducible anatomic points on sagittal feet radiographs. The key starting point of our evaluation was the previously undescribed length and position of the talus joint line (TJL), from the border of the articular surface of the talus and the posterior process of talus. First, we calculated the relationships between the TJL and the axes of the foot, particularly the anatomic and mechanical lateral talometatarsal angle axes of the first metatarsal. Then, we assessed the relationships with the calcaneus, particularly the lateral heel angle. Finally, we calculated the parameters (angles and coefficients k) derived from the TJL and the foot-bearing points (foot quadrilateral). A total of 64 normal radiographs from 55 patients were analyzed. The values that resulted are as follows: anatomic lateral talometatarsal angleâ¯=â¯28.5Â° Â± 4.5Â°, mechanical lateral talometatarsal angleâ¯=â¯23.6Â° Â± 3.2Â°, lateral heel angleâ¯=â¯15.2Â° Â± 3.4Â°, foot quadrilateral: abcâ¯=â¯144.6Â° Â± 9.4Â°, bcdâ¯=â¯31.3Â° Â± 2.6Â°, cdaâ¯=â¯79.2Â° Â± 9.8Â°, dabâ¯=â¯105.0Â° Â± 8.3Â°, k1â¯=â¯3.09 Â± 0.4, k2â¯=â¯3.77 Â± 0.78, and k3â¯=â¯1.56 Â± 0.24. Sagittal plane reference lines and angles are proposed, providing quantitative values for reference. These parameters have the potential to be easily implemented in foot deformity analysis and correction planning.\n",

Evaluation of forefoot radiography has played an important role to determine the forefoot deformity. Previous studies have shown that normal radiographic values of the western population were different from the Asian population values. To examine the normal range of radiologic values of forefoot in Thai women. The data collected at out-patient division of the hospital for screening 100 women (200 feet). All patients have been radiographed in the AP standing position (to measure the HVA, 1st IMA, DMAA, sesamoid AP and 1st metatarsal length) and weight bearing tangential view to determine the SRA angle. The average results of the right and the left foot HVA = 10.75 degrees, 9.39 degrees/1st IMA = 10.24 degrees, 9.20 degrees/DMAA = 3.72 degrees, 3.32 degrees/sesamoid AP grade 0-1 = 85 percent, 82 percent/ SRA = 9.14 degrees, 8 degrees respectively, 1st metatarsal length was shorter than the 2nd metatarsal length in most cases (70%) and when comparing between the right and the left foot, no statistical significant difference were found (p &gt; 0.05). Study found that the values of HVA, DMAA and the 1st metatarsal length in Thai women were less than the values found in the foreign literatures but it was similar to the Asian population figures.\n",

      "Superconstructs in reconstruction surgery of Charcot foot Brodsky 1: A case report. Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy (CN) is a chronic, progressive condition of joints, soft tissues, and bones. CN causes considerable high mortality and morbidity. A common issue is early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Thus, the operative treatment is indicated when patients have progressive deformities, infection and ulceration. The superconstructs method for Charcot foot (CF) is considered giving better clinical outcome than other methods. A 61-year-old male admitted to an outpatient clinic with chief complaint of swelling and pain on a left foot with history of diabetes mellitus type 2. From the physical examination, left foot revealed a swelling with rocker bottom deformity and limited range of motion. The radiological examination showed sclerotic appearance of bone deformity metatarsal joint of midfoot of toe. The patients were diagnosed with left Charcot foot Brodsky Type 1, Eichenholtz grade III with diabetes mellitus type 2. We made superconstructs rather than standard fixation which is frequently inadequate due to changes accompanying the Charcot process. Thus, we performed an adequate reduction of deformity, reduce soft tissue tension, fixation extension beyond a zone of injury, then use of strongest fixation devices that are applied to maximize mechanical function. This study showed that superconstructs provide satisfactory clinical and outcomes. This method is useful for achieving construct and stable fixation especially for Charcot foot.\n",

      "The management of mirror foot polydactyly: A case report. Mirror foot or mirror image duplication of the foot is an extreme form and very rare congenital anomaly. There are limited management recommendations, and most cases are treated before walking age. We present the clinical findings, surgical treatment, and results of a rare case of mirror foot polydactyly. A five-month-old girl with bilateral mirror foot was referred to our orthopaedic department. She was born full-term by the caesarian section and there was no family history of similar skeletal abnormalities and no history of drug or radiation exposure during gestation. The child had eight toes on the right foot and seven toes on the left with fully developed metatarsal, proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. Radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of mirror foot with a full complement of normal lateral toes and three additional complete rays medial to the right foot and two additional complete rays medial to the left foot. The patient underwent ray resection and concurrent reconstruction of the medial arch of the foot. A medial longitudinal incision was used to excised the right medial three rays and left medial two rays. The target of this surgical intervention was for aesthetic or cosmetic reasons and enabling the patient to allow shoe wear. Mirror-foot abnormalities are distinctly uncommon entities and represent extreme forms of congenital duplication of the preaxial polydactyly spectrum. Treatment on age of five-month-old with medial longitudinal incision had a satisfying clinical and radiological results.\n",

Women with heavy periods at baseline were no more likely to develop psychological distress 6 months later than women with non-heavy periods (adjusted odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.73, 1.63). Similar findings existed with respect to intermenstrual bleeding and postcoital bleeding. Results of the 12-month analysis were similar. In the community, psychological distress appears to influence the future self-reporting of heavy periods and other symptoms of vaginal bleeding.\n",

    "STD interactive case challenge--diagnosing and treating chronic vulvar pain and erythema. A 36-year-old Caucasian woman arrives in your office, her chief complaint being vulvar pain and discomfort of 2 years' duration. She says that the onset of vulvar erythema and pain was gradual, beginning with mild tingling discomfort and eventually developing into dyspareunia and pain whenever she attempted to insert tampons, wore tight-fitting pants, or went horseback riding. The patient denies having vaginal discharge, change in menstrual pattern, or dysuria. She says she complained of the problem to several previous clinicians, who recommended anti-infective treatment for candidal vulvovaginitis, bacterial vaginosis, and recurrent cystitis, yet the symptoms persisted. One physician suggested a psychiatric evaluation, but the patient refused. She switched soap, shampoo, and even underwear fabric in an unsuccessful effort to ameliorate the symptoms. Over the past 6 months she has become increasingly frustrated with this problem.\n",

    "A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist’s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?\n",
