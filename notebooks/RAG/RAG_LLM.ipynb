The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents is increasing in both the United States and Mexico. The goal of this article was to assess the efficacy and safety of sibutramine in obese Mexican adolescents. This was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial of sibutramine QD. Male and female patients aged 14 to 18 years with sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age and sex &gt;85th percentile were eligible. The primary end points for the trial were the baseline versus end point absolute values for body weight, BMI, and percentage of the initial BMI (%BMI); secondary end points were waist circumference and percentage of the initial waist circumference (%waist). These were measured at days -15, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 of the study. Quality of life was assessed at the study start and end using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Both groups received individually tailored diet and exercise programs. Forty-six patients (age range, 14-18 years) with a BMI &gt;95th percentile for age were included (sibutramine group, n = 23 [14 females, 9 males]; placebo group, n = 23 [12 females, 11 males]). Twenty-one patients in the sibutramine group and 19 patients in the placebo group completed the 6-month trial. Using the intent-to-treat data, weight (mean [SD]) in the sibutramine group changed from 92.5 (14.6) kg to 85.7 (14.4) kg, for a net weight loss of 7.3 kg (95% CI 4.6-9.9), a waist circumference loss of 8.0 cm (95% CI, 4.7-11.3), and a % BMI loss of 9.2% (95% CI, 6.9-11.6). In the placebo group, weight changed from 98.9 (22.7) kg to 94.6 (22.5) kg, a weight loss of 4.3 kg (95% CI, 1.7-6.9), a waist circumference loss of 3.8 cm (95% CI, 0.7-7.0), and a %BMI loss of 5.2% (95% CI, 2.4-7.9) (P &lt; 0.05 for all intragroup comparisons; P &gt; 0.05 for the intergroup comparisons). Mean (SD) scores on the SF-36 scale in the sibutramine group changed from 78.0 (13.3) at baseline to 84.8 (7.4) at study end (P &lt; 0.05); the respective values in the placebo group were 82.8 (10.3) and 87.3 (7.6) (P &lt; 0.05). At base-line, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 116.7 (5.9) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 118.3 (7.6) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective SBPs were 112.4 (9.6) mm Hg and 112.6 (6.5) mm Hg. At baseline, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 78.9 (4.5) mm Hg in the sibutramine group and 79.5 (5.2) mm Hg in the placebo group; at end point, the respective DBPs were 73.5 (6.3) mm Hg and 76.6 (6.2) mm Hg. At baseline, heart rate was 76.3 (6.4) beats/min in the sibutramine group and 81.1 (9.5) beats/min in the placebo group; at end point, the respective findings were 79.8 (8.8) beats/min and 77.6 (8.6) beats/min (P &gt; 0.05 for all preceding intergroup comparisons). One patient in the sibutramine group had increased blood pressure (at month 3) and 3 had increased heart rate (at months 1, 2, and 4); 2 patients receiving placebo had increased blood pressure (month 3) and 2 had increased heart rate (at months 1 and 3). These changes disappeared in 1 week and did not require treatment or trial suspension. Additionally, in the sibutramine group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: headache, dry mouth, headache with nausea, and headache with weakness and paleness (P &gt; 0.05). In the placebo group, 3 patients experienced 4 mild AEs: 2 cases of headache, as well as 1 case of headache with somnolence and 1 case of headache with dry mouth (P &gt; 0.05).

Since 1987, four randomized controlled clinical trials with 872 nonhypertensive subjects have produced results on weight-reducing interventions, involving decreased caloric intake and/or increased expenditure, for effects on blood pressure (BP). The Hypertension Prevention Trial maintained a 3.5-kg net weight loss through 36 months with intake reduction alone. This program decreased BP by 2.4/1.8 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic) compared to controls, but both weight loss and blood pressure changes were smaller when combined with decreased sodium intake. A Stanford University trial achieved weight losses of 7.4 and 5.1 kg over 12 months with diet and exercise, respectively. Effects on clinic BP were in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 mm Hg and did not differ by intervention approach. The sole trial in children, conducted at University of Michigan, found similar weight loss (about 7 kg) and BP effects from limiting caloric intake over 20 weeks, regardless of inclusion of an exercise program; the latter did, however, result in greater reductions in percent body fat, heart rate, and serum insulin levels. The Primary Prevention of Hypertension trial tested a multifactor intervention including reductions in weight (mean, 2.7 kg), sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity. During a 5-year period, clinic BP was reduced by 2.0/1.9 mm Hg, and the incidence of hypertension, by 52%. It is concluded that weight loss, however achieved, lowers BP in overweight nonhypertensive persons, and probably can contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of hypertension. Whether there are independent effects additive to weight loss from increasing physical activity and reducing sodium intake remains unknown.\"\n",

An attending orthopaedic surgeon, an orthopaedic resident, and a spine Fellow are scheduled to perform a multilevel spinal decompression and instrumentation from L3 to S1. The case is delayed for several hours and begins in the late afternoon. The attending orthopaedist chooses not to wait for localization radiographs and proceeds with the decompression and four-level pedicle screw instrumentation with posterior-lateral fusion. The Fellow suggests several times during the procedure that radiographs should be obtained, but the attending surgeon is late for a meeting and declines to obtain radiographs. The attending surgeon leaves the resident and Fellow to close the wound after spinal instrumentation and fusion is complete. Radiographs are obtained prior to closure of the wound, and these indicate that the decompression has been performed at the appropriate levels but that the spinal instrumentation and fusion was from L2 to L5 rather than from L3 to S1. The Fellow notifies the attending surgeon, who has already left the hospital. The Fellow offers to remove the L2 screws, place S1 screws, and reconfigure the instrumentation prior to closing. The attending surgeon forbids the Fellow to do this and tells her, \"Everything will be fine.\" He also states that he will discuss the surgery with the patient and family in the morning. As ordered, the Fellow and the resident close the wound.\"\"\"\n",

    "# rag_1_3 = \"\"\"When should a surgical resident call an attending surgeon? Many interactions exist between surgical residents and attending surgeons, where residents debate whether they should \"bother\" to call an attending. Several instances have occurred when a senior resident or an attending has not been notified about a patient's status by a junior resident. Because of poor communication, care might be delayed, and surgeons and patients' relatives might not be informed of a change in status. Sometimes the resident's initial management was different than an attending's management. Communication issues were raised at our weekly Morbidity &amp; Mortality conference. We decided to investigate the range of judgment as to when a resident should notify an attending surgeon. The objective was to investigate the range of judgment as to when a surgical resident should notify an attending surgeon. The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical circumstances when surgical residents should contact an attending surgeon directly or leave a message with the service. To investigate communication questions, we developed a survey of 34 clinical circumstances in which a surgical resident could call an attending. Sixteen residents and 16 attendings completed the survey entitled \"Conditions where a surgical resident should consider contacting the surgical attending.\" From the information obtained from this study, a \"must leave message\" and \"must speak to directly\" list were created to guide residents as to when to call an attending. A significant difference existed in the answers provided by residents and attendings. Residents and attendings agreed universally that an attending should be spoken to directly for 2 reasons: cardiopulmonary arrest and death. We created a \"must speak to directly\" list based on the attendings' answers. This list includes 10 clinical circumstances in which a surgical resident should speak directly with an attending regarding patient issues. Likewise, a \"must leave message\" list was created of an additional 8 reasons when a surgical resident must at least call the service of an attending and leave a message. The purpose of our study was to help standardize communication between surgical residents and attendings regarding patient status. With these 2 standardized \"must\" lists, residents will have less uncertainty or hesitation to awaken an attending at night. This finding should improve the communication skills of surgical residents and ultimately improve the quality of patient care.\"\"\"\n",

A case of a 62-year-old Austrian man having a 25-year history of a right-sided carotid body tumor (CBT) is presented. Three months before being transferred to the University of Vienna for tumor resection the patient developed symptoms of tinnitus, progressive ipsilateral hearing loss and dysphagia. Pure-tone audiometry demonstrated a 50 dB right sensorineural hearing loss. A 6 x 6 x 4 cm firm, pulsatile mass was found in the right carotid triangle and extending towards the base of the skull. One week after radical tumor resection all preoperative symptoms disappeared and hearing of the right ear recovered. Review of the available literature showed that hearing loss and tinnitus are unusual symptoms of a CBT.
